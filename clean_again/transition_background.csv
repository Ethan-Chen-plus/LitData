This paper studies the causal long-run impacts of individual experiences on intimate partner violence. Specifically, we focus on exposure to collective gender-based violence and ask how wartime exposure to sexual violence against women affects veterans’ long-run propensity to commit intimate partner violence.

We study the impact of exposure to wartime sexual violence for two?main reasons. First, perpetrating or witnessing violence is often associated with engaging in violent behavior in the future – ‘violence begets violence’ (Pollak, 2004; Littman and Paluck, 2015). Second, sexual violence is among the most intense and recurring forms of gender-based violence and war atrocities,affecting millions of people across the world as victims and perpetrators. Starting with events in Bosnia and Rwanda, awareness for wartime sexual violence in the globalpolicy discourse has increased rapidly, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820 recognizes that “rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutiveact with respectto genocide” (UN, 2008, p. 3). Nonetheless, armed groups around the world continue to perpetrate sexual violence, including contexts as diverse as Liberia, Eastern Congo, Colombia, Timor–Leste, Pakistan, or Iraq and Syria (Cohen et al., 2013). </s>"

To keep students engaged and learning during school closures, governments around the world abruptly shifted to distance learning.?In low-income countries, the medium with the greatest reach is radio. The Government of Sierra Leone, like many others, announced a national radio teaching programme shortly after schools closed in March 2020. Many governments and partners complemented radio teaching with SMS-based reminders. In Sierra Leone, a number of non-state organisations, including our implementation partner Rising Academy Network, supported the Government to develop content for the radio teaching programme and provided SMS reminders. Missing from these and similar efforts, however, is any direct interaction between teachers and students. Teachers add significant value to student learning (Chetty et al., 2014), but little of that value is explained by teacher characteristics (Bau and Das, 2020), suggesting that effective interactions may drive teacher effects. </s>"

The paper contributes to the sparse literature identifying causal impacts of manufacturing work on the agency of women in poor countries. The combined shocks to textile demand from the US durig the 200809 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and the gradual phase-out of the MFA together resulted in a large, temporary, decline in RMG employment in Lesotho. Because of the lack of other well-paid employment for women, these shocks to RMG demand provide an opportunity to examine the impact of a high-wage, formalised work environment on women’s say in resource allocation in households and measures of women’s health. A pseudo-panel spanning 2004–2014 is constructed to identify causal impacts of RMG employment on these outcomes. Women who reside closer to potential RMG employment are more likely to work in the?sector. Exogenous variation in RMG employment propensities from the combination of distance between a woman’s residence and the nearest IZ and these demand shocks is exploited for inference.

The RMG sector began in the early 1980s with investments from South Africa. These investments were facilitated by the Lesotho National Development Cooperation. Investors could circumvent sanctions on South Africa which otherwise prevented selling to the US and European markets (UNCTAD, 2002, Steele, 2002, Gibbon, 2003). By 2004, the RMG sector had become the main non-agricultural employer in Lesotho, engaged more formal-sector workers than the government, and was the source of a majority of export revenue (Lall, 2006, International Finance Corporation, 2010). Under AGOA, foreign direct investment in Lesotho increased substantially (Central Bank of Lesotho, 2004, Central Bank of Lesotho, 2005). The sector is dominated by Taiwanese and South African-owned factories producing for the US market (Balchin and Calabrese, 2019, World Trade Organization, 2017). As of 2017, about 82% of workers were women. In 2017, the RMG sector employed about 46500 workers in Lesotho, down from a peak of 54 000 in early 2003 (Lesotho Ministry of Trade and Industry, 2017).

RMG production is concentrated primarily in the suburbs of Maseru, the national capital, and Thetsane, Mafeteng, Leribe and Mohale’s Hoek. The Maseru zone remains the largest employer, likely because transportation costs for finished goods are lowest from this location. The proximity of the Maseru suburbs to the railhead leading to the South African sea port of Durban also lowers lag time between orders and deliveries.

Wages and working conditions in the RMG sector are strongly regulated in Lesotho. A child labour ban is enforced by the government. RMG sector workers are also generally unionised, and may have access to on-site childcare and healthcare (Gibbon, 2003). Factories operating in the IZs pay much higher wages both relative to local alternatives and relative to those paid in other RMG host countries including Vietnam and Bangladesh. In 2007, the average monthly earnings of an employee in the RMG sector was $US 103, and the minimum monthly earnings for a general textile worker in Lesotho was $US 93 (RMG Bangladesh, 2016). In 2007, annual GDP per capita was far lower: 846 current US$, a monthly equivalent of 71 US$ (World Bank, 2022b). Still, production costs were internationally competitive in the early 2000s. Eifert et al. (2005) calculated the labour costs per shirt produced in Lesotho in 2004 as 0.19 current US dollars, far under the 0.65 for South Africa and 0.29 for export processing zones in China. The minimum monthly earnings for a textile worker had risen to $US 138 by August 2018 (Abdullah Al Mahfuz, 2018). </s>"

State expropriation is generally justified by the public interest. The state is expected to employ expropriation as a policy tool to provide?public goods and to develop the economy more generally.3 Since these goals deliver benefits to the public, whether expropriation has political costs, and if so, how detrimental the costs are, could be contextdependent. Public perceptions of the motivations for expropriation could influence the extent to which expropriation leads to adverse political impacts. To explore this relationship, this study examines two circumstances that may enable the state to implement expropriation projects without losing citizens’ political support. First, if local officials have a reputation for good governance, the expropriation projects are likely to be well managed and justified and the process of expropriation may be implemented in a manner which is more transparent. In this case, state expropriation may not necessarily have high political costs. Second, public use of the expropriated resources may be important. When the projects generate public benefits, the interests of both the government and the citizens are aligned and adverse political impacts may not emerge.

China provides an excellent empirical setting to study the political consequences of state expropriation. As the world’s largest developing country, China has employed land expropriation to support development policies for several decades. Local governments have the authority to seize agricultural land and provide relatively low compensation. It is striking that, according to the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a nationally representative longitudinal survey, the proportion of households who have had at least some of their land expropriated by 2018 was 30% (see Fig. 1). There is no doubt that land expropriation has contributed to China’s economic development and growth by facilitating infrastructure construction and urbanization.4 However, are there political costs associated with this development policy? And if so, is it possible for the government to mitigate the costs? Little is known quantitatively about these questions, although they are of great interest and policy relevance.

This paper argues that land expropriation incurs political costs for the Chinese government. The Wukan event, which attracted worldwide attention, provides a vivid illustration.5 In September 2011, Wukan villagers launched large-scale violent protests against the government after they discovered that the village and township governments transferred more than half of their agricultural land to a private real estate company without ex-ante negotiation or providing proper compensation to villagers. Some managers including the vice-CEO of the private company were village cadres, suggesting that corruption may have occurred at the local level.6 Before organizing the protests, the villagers?petitioned the provincial government but received no satisfactory resolution. After interacting with local government officials, some villagers were arrested and jailed; and one died after being arrested by the police. During the process, the villagers gradually lost their trust in the local government and called for an investigation by the central government. Finally, a peaceful agreement between the villagers and the government was reached after a top provincial leader intervened and acknowledged the villagers’ basic demands. </s>"

As a fundamental market force, product market competition has become more intense in recent decades. Waves of trade liberalization, including recent developments in China, have significantly shifted the domestic landscape of competition and induced firms to transform themselves in various ways (Bloom et al., 2016). We use the largesttrade liberalization in China, marked by China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001, to examine whether and how firms alter their ownership choices in response to trade-induced?competition.2 Abundant anecdotal evidence suggests that firm managers consider the nature and potential roles of ownersas a core aspectof their firms’ strategy sets and activelyconsider whether to adjust ownership to strengthen firms’ competitiveness. For example, Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, the largest construction machinery manufacturer and distributor in China, has actively sought to introduce strategic investors since 2002 to facilitate its structural reform, improve its technology management expertise and corporate governance, and raise capital.3 More recently, Suning.com, a large online retailer in China, introduced government-backed strategic investors to mitigate its financial distress and reduce operational frictions.4 Given the strategic roles that different ownership types can play in a competitiveenvironment, we hypothesize that certain changes in state and foreign shareholders are avenues for firms to strengthen their competitiveness. </s>"

Research suggests that in countries with a preference for boys, prenatal sex selection may be a substitute for forms of postnatal discrimination such as infanticide, malnourishment, and an overall lower level of investment in female children (Kalsi, 2015, Lin et al., 2014). Given the issue of substitution across forms of discrimination, policies aimed at reducing the demand for boys by targeting the underlying son preference are preferable to policies that restrict the supply of sex selection technologies. In this paper, I explore whether improving the status of women within society could reduce son preference.

I take advantage of a 1993 amendment to India's constitution, which established a three-tier system of rural governing local bodies (Panchayats) within each state. States were required to develop Panchayats at the village, the block, and the district level. The law also required that these newly developed Panchayats reserve one-third of all political positions, including those of chairpersons, for women. As a result, a state's adoption of the law led to a drastic increase in female political representation at local levels within the state. </s>"

The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether and how an increased participation of women in the decision-making body of local collective action institutions - the Executive Committee (EC) of Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) in Nepal - affects forest protection, specifically the quantity of firewood collected by the households.

Firewood extraction is considered as one of the main causes of deforestation and forest degradation (Baland et al., 2010, 2018; Edmonds, 2002). Therefore, a reduction in the quantity of firewood collected would imply better forest conditions. The hypothesis I want to test is whether a higher female representation in ECs of CFUGs contributes to better forest management and hence to forest protection.

Nepal is a particularly suitable country for this analysis. In 1993 the government of Nepal promulgated a Forest Act which established the transfer of national forests to local communities. Since then Community Forest User Groups (FUGs from now on) have been formed for the management and protection of these forests. These groups can autonomously manage the forests and decide on the distribution of benefits deriving from the forest resources.

The Executive Committee of each FUG plays a critical role in defining the forest products extraction rules and its composition is therefore crucial for the functioning and effectiveness of these institutions. I use two national representative household surveys, the 2004 and 2011 Nepal Living Standard Measurement Surveys, and combine them with a census of all FUGs formed in the country. This is a unique feature of the analysis.

In 2009 an amendment to the Community Forest programme's operational guidelines set at 50 percent the minimum threshold for female representation in the ECs of FUGs. Although the new policy was not legally binding, the new provision actually increased female participation within these local institutions. According to the census of FUGs, in groups formed after 2009 the average percentage of women in the ECs was 44 and 42 for groups formed in 2010 and 2011 respectively. In groups formed before 2010 the average proportion of women in the ECs ranged between 25 and 38 percent.

This study is motivated by the fact that minimal research has been devoted to exploring gender differences within community-based institutions established for natural resources management. However, women are largely responsible for the collection and use of firewood and other forest products within a household. Despite being important stakeholders in forest management, they are often neglected in the decision-making process that sets out the rules to access and collect forest products within a Community Forest (CF). This under-representation together with pre-existing gender inequalities within the household and the society as a whole, poses serious concerns for women who have the primary responsibility for the collection of forest products within the household (Agarwal, 2007). The recognition of the essential role that women play within community level forest institutions can make a difference in terms of forest conservation and equity in the distribution of benefits. </s>"

While some attention has been devoted to classical school inputs targeting equally all students in the classroom, these could be inadequate to help strengthening education quality.1 Targeting more and better school inputs to those students lagging behind could be the way to go, namely in settings where student heterogeneity is significant (Banerjee et al., 2007). At the same time, computer technology enabled pedagogical methods to be more tailored to the specific needs of individual students. Many programs have been trying to improve education quality in developing countries through the use of technology. However, experimental evidence from various parts of the world reviewed by Escueta et al. (2017) proves that simply providing schools with computers is unlikely to improve children’s academic performance. Differently, computer hardware combined with Computer-assisted Learning (CAL) software has demonstrated clear positive impacts on student achievement, in particular when individual customization of contents is possible, e.g., Muralidharan et al. (2019). Important questions do however remain about how to link these CAL programs to regular teachers and classroom dynamics. In particular, involving teachers could help a variety of outcomes including decreasing their absenteeism.

The context of our study is the capital city of Luanda, Angola.3 Angola is a suitable illustration of an expanded but low-performing school system. The Gross Enrollment Rate in Angola’s primary education grew from an estimated 71% in 1998 to 113% in 2015. However, in 2014 its youth literacy rate was close to the average of Sub-Saharan African countries, at 77% (World Bank, World Development Indicators, 2019). Sizeable heterogeneity in students’ abilities within each classroom is common. Hence, it is clear that the main challenge today in Angola, like in other African countries, is to increase the quality of education. </s>"

Specifically, we analyze the effect of a prominent aid program in China, the so-called 156 Program supported by the Soviet Union during the 1950s, on contemporary Sino-Russian trade patterns. Next, we offer a new mechanism to explain why the effect exists and persists after decades. The previous theory linking aid and trade relies mainly on the fact that the donor countries exert political influence on the recipients through aid programs to intentionally increase their economic dependence (Richardson, 1976; Roeder, 1985; Alesina and Dollar, 2000). However, since political influence might diminish as soon as aid programs are terminated, it can hardly explain the effects of aid in the long run. Instead, we posit that aid can build social capital, for example, in the form of affinity or trust between donors and recipients, which then facilitates long-term economic exchanges.

Next, we take a step toward understanding why aid continues to increase trade after several decades.   Although a bunch of channels may be relevant, a definitive accounting of the role of each channel is beyond the scope of our study.   Instead, we aim to strengthen a specific interpretation that aid fosters intergroup affinity or trust, which may further facilitate bilateral trade in the long run.   In the spirit of Guiso et al.

At the end of World War I, after three decades as a German colony, the western territories of today's Cameroon were divided between France and the United Kingdom under a League of Nations mandate. The French and British territories were delimited by an arbitrary border, drawn up in Europe, that cut across politically, economically, demographically and geographically homogeneous regions. Historical records provide evidence that French and British colonial practices affected women on the two sides of the border in significantly different ways. Several British colonial policies created new educational and occupational opportunities for women. For example, girls benefited from a protestant education system that aimed at educating both girls and boys, and women gained opportunities to earn cash wages in the export oriented agriculture sector, under the same conditions as their male counterparts. In contrast, the French colonial practice in these domains centered around educating a small administrative elite and investing in the male employment dominated infrastructure sector, to build railways and roads. In 1961, the political evolution of Cameroon culminated in the reunification of its divided colonies into an independent state. </s>"

What role, if any, have these political reservations had for women's participation in the workforce? Despite the many positive impacts associated with these reforms, their contributions to promoting women's engagement in the local economy remain uncertain. These relationships are critical for identifying the short- and long-term impact of such policies. Significant empowerment of women in the workforce and as business owners may be the strongest mechanism possible for entrenching and amplifying the positive impacts associated with these political reservations.

We consider in particular the role of women in the manufacturing sector from 1994 to 2005. The unorganized sector of Indian manufacturing is comprised of establishments with fewer than 10 employees (or fewer than 20 if the establishment does not use electricity). Our data report gender-based ownership and employment in unorganized manufacturing establishments by state and industry in 1994, 2000 and 2005. The unorganized sector is of particular interest as it has constituted approximately 99% and 80% of total manufacturing establishment counts and employment in India consistently since the early 1990s. We also observe gender-based employment in the organized sector, which is comprised of all plants above the indicated employment thresholds. On the whole, the female ownership share of Indian manufacturing business more than doubled during our period of study: in 1994, female-owned businesses comprised 9% of total manufacturing employment; by 2005, this share had grown tremendously to 19% (Ghani et al., 2013c). Therefore it is of crucial importance to understand more deeply the factors that have contributed to this sharp emergence of female entrepreneurship and business ownership over a relatively short time period. </s>"

This enduring and important paradox in the literature has been called the “Asian enigma” (Ramalingaswami et al., 1996). India's height deficit relative to Africa is large: it is about two-fifths as large as the average rural-urban height gap in India, and almost one-quarter as large as the average difference in India between children of literate and illiterate mothers. This defecit impacts many people because 19% of births occur in India.

Sanitation, when poor, can be a key determinant of human capital in developing countries. This is because germs from feces cause diarrhea and other diseases, which can consume energy and harm the overall nutrition of growing children and of the mothers who nurture them in pregnancy and early life. Medical research indicates that chronic environmental exposure to fecal germs could be an important cause of growth deficits. This paper documents a large and robust gradient between exposure to open defecation and child height. As we show, sanitation can explain international variation in child height that income and other dimensions of development cannot. Our main conclusion is that open defecation can statistically account for much or all of the average height-for-age difference between India and Africa, in the sense that children in India are projected to be taller by at least as much as the gap, if counterfactually exposed to the African distribution of open defecation density.

Over one billion people worldwide defecate in the open (meaning without using any toilet or latrine), most of these in India (Coffey and Spears, 2017). For reasons related to the history and endurance of the caste system, sanitation coverage is exceptionally poor in India, a densely populated country where most people1 defecate in the open. This is a much larger prevalence of open defecation than in other countries with similar economic status. Perhaps surprisingly in light of how much open defecation there is, and how different sanitation in India is from sanitation elsewhere, sanitation received little prior attention in economists' wide-ranging investigations of the puzzle of Indian malnutrition and stunting (e.g. Deaton, 2007; Tarozzi, 2008; Jensen, 2012; Panagariya, 2013). </s>"

In recent decades, however, as China has become wealthier and pollution problems have created large dissatisfaction among the public, pollution reduction has become a high priority for the government. In 2014, at the Communist party's annual congress, Premier Li Keqiang declared war on air pollution in China. At the party congress in 2017, he renewed his vow to “make our skies blue again.” As China has published a series of policies and plans aimed at addressing environmental problems, the urgent question to answer is as follows: Who will bear the cost? Unlike developed countries where the cost and benefit analysis has long been considered in the policy design process, policymakers in developing countries such as China have only recently begun to pay attention to the potential costs of environmental policies. With the increasing intensity of environmental governance, China's already heavy burden under which it must constantly create new jobs simply to prevent unemployment from increasing may become even heavier. Therefore, estimating the potential impacts of air pollution control on employment, identifying vulnerable groups, and providing corresponding policy recommendations in China is particularly urgent. </s>"

This article aims to evaluate the responses and adaptations of agricultural TFPs to climate change in China, which is the largest global emitters and largest developing country boasting the largest agricultural economy and population.  China’s mitigation policy aims at reducing GHG emissions intensity, through industrial structure adjustment, energy consumption structure optimization, energy efficiency improvement, carbon sequestration capacity enhancement, and pilot carbon trading, among others.  By 2017, carbon intensity in China had dropped by about 46% compared with 2005.  In terms of adaptation policies, apart from China’s National Climate Change Programme, we have been unable to find policies at the national level specifically targeting agricultural adaptation to climate change.  However, some other policies, such as the “One Exemption and Three Subsidies” policy,2 are not only designed to ensure food security and increase farmers’ income, but also improve agricultural adaptation to climate change.  This is because they not only encourage innovation and adoption of heat-resistant and drought-resistant species that can reduce productivity loss, but also motivate more investments in agriculture.  Understanding how these policies mitigate agricultural losses in the context of global warming through two channels including productivity and input utilization, is of great significance for developing more effective adaptation policies.  Hence, this article also aims to identify the mechanism by which climate change affects yield through its impact on TFP and input utilization, as well as the mechanism of adaptation behaviors of Chinese farmers.The data used for this study comes from two sources.  On the one hand, a county-year panel data for 2495 counties consisting of specific agricultural inputs and outputs over the period of 1981–2015 is used to construct four agricultural TFP measures under various specifications to rule out the effect of labor, fertilizer and machinery on yield.  On the other hand, comprehensive daily weather records from 820 weather stations are merged to these 2495 counties using the inverse distance weighting method (IDW), which makes it possible to further investigate how inputs and TFPs are affected by climate change. </s>"

China's substantially strengthened enforcement of green credit regulations in 2012 further provide an excellent opportunity to identify the causal effect of green credit on firms' external financial conditions through a difference-in-difference strategy. Given the limited regulatory capacity of governments,2 the potential of the financial sector in environmental protection was re-affirmed and substantially enhanced by the Guideline on Green Credit, enacted in February 2012 in China. In contrast to pure market mechanisms spontaneously adopted by banks, such as the Equator Principle, green credit in China features pressures on banks which are obliged to account for environmental risks. Any failure to adhere to the rules might trigger sanctions on banks and are likely to detrimentally impact banks' achievement assessments, which serve as important bases for governmental regulatory ratings of banks, banks' market access and their managers' achievement evaluation. Therefore, echoing Foster and Gutierrez (2013) who find that voluntary certification can provide an important complement to mandatory inspections as a basis for environmental regulation in low-income countries, our investigation on the effect of green credit in the context of China's green credit mechanism also helps to determine the role that financial markets can play, especially in an environment with limited government capacity. </s>"

This study attempts to bridge this gap by documenting novel empirical evidence and measuring the benefits of fuel standards in the largest developing country, China. More precisely, it investigates the relationship between China's fuel standards, which specify lower sulfur content, and levels of air pollution. There are three reasons for this focus. First, China has become the world's largest automobile market. There has been an unprecedented increase in the country's vehicle ownership, shown in Fig. 1. Intensive oil consumption is associated with a large number of externalities (Parry et al., 2007). China's cities rank among the most polluted in the world (World Bank, 2007; Greenstone and Hanna, 2014; Chen et al., 2013; Cropper, 2010). That makes regulating fuel content of great policy relevance. Second, uniform fuel standards have gradually been introduced in Chinese cities, which provides a new opportunity to understand their environmental implications. The different standards together with accurate data allow overcoming methodological obstacles that have impeded progress in this field.

Third, Chinese fuel standards generally follow the practices of Europe, Japan and the United States. Very similar regulations facilitate meaningful international comparisons of policy effectiveness. Apart from the detailed insights into the role of policy in the current setting, some general lessons could emerge which would enrich our view of fuel content regulations in a broader context. </s>"

Our analysis leverages a novel source of high-resolution satellite data on night-time boat detection in Vietnam's marine exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and relates it to employment data from the Vietnamese labor force surveys. Exploiting both the industry-specific and location-specific natures of the Formosa shock, our identification strategy compares fishery workers that lived in the affected region to both non-fishery workers in the same area and other fishery workers outside the affected zone. //研究内容

Our paper focuses on evaluating the short-run, immediate impacts of Formosa on fishery workers, and how the affected fishers adapted to this extreme shock to their livelihoods, for at least two important reasons. First, fishery is the third-most dominant sector in Vietnam, accounting for 19.97 percent of the country's total agricultural GDP in 2016 and 9–10 percent total export revenues (General Statistics Office, 2016b). Fishery-related activities also make up a considerable share of the economics in the central Vietnam. At the four-digit Vietnam Standard Industrial Classification (VSIC) level, the single sub-industry of saltwater fishery accounts for 3.8 and 7.3 percent of total employment and income in coastal districts2 of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Hue in 2015 (General Statistics Office, 2016a). Second, the Vietnamese fishery sector is characterized as being predominantly small-scale and concentrated in coastal near-shore waters (Pomeroy et al., 2009).3 Due to this nature of the industry, majority of Vietnamese fishers face considerable restriction on the length and types of their fishing voyage. Fishery earnings are also highly vulnerable to uncertainties in fishing condition—from unfavorable climates to extreme, albeit rare, incidents like Formosa. Because we are interested in examining the immediate impact of the crisis, we confine the scope of the analysis to the period before any formal source of compensation was distributed, i.e., the rest of 2016.4 The time frame of our analysis allows us to cleanly evaluate fishery economic damages and adaptation activities during the most urgent time, thereby providing insights related to the timing, effectiveness, and equality of assistance policies. </s>"

As their frequency and intensity increase geometrically over time, storms constitute a major avenue of change in political conditions. We start with the observation that major natural shocks typically increase pre-existing group disparities and induce political exclusions and societal grievances via their enormous fatalities and overwhelming material destruction. In their aftermath, if governments fail to adequately compensate victims for their losses, survivors may stage protests, exhibit anti-government political behavior, and even launch massive insurgencies.3 Thus, when a disaster with such implications occurs, the government faces a dilemma: either incur the cost of a major disaster relief effort or confront the cost of a possible insurgency, with the consequent possibility of being overthrown. In most cases, the government rightfully deems the latter cost larger, especially if the government itself is not an autocratic one, because such governments cannot effectively fight attempts to overthrow them.

Based on this intuition, our stylized dynamic game-theoretic model of citizen–government interactions in the wake of storms yields a unique equilibrium whereby the government opts to deliver to citizens adequate and effective post-disaster relief, as a result of which citizens refrain from insurgency even if the government resorts to autocracy. Consequently, the incumbent government can tighten its grip over the polity by increasing state control in the aftermath of the shock. This means that storms end up provoking autocratic tendencies through a mutually-agreed political repression, generating a specific type of political regime for which we coin the name “storm autocracies”. </s>"

The end of this trade-related uncertainty has triggered exceptional export growth in China (Pierce and Schott, 2016, Feng et al., 2017) and had wide-ranging economic consequences (e.g., Facchini et al., 2019, Liu and Ma, 2020, Erten and Leight, 2021). </s>"

In addition, vocational education may not grant equal access to higher education, where general education does. In developing countries, quality differences between vocational and general education tracks, the lower permeability of education systems, and the scarcity of formal jobs for which vocational and general education graduates compete may further influence the trade-off between vocational and general education. </s>"

Firstly, it is virtually impossible for an agent in the illegal market to formally employ anyone. As a result, agents resort to informal labor, where there are no institutions mediating employer–employee relationships; this is particularly true in rural, poor, and isolated sites, where workers generally have little bargaining power to set favorable work conditions. Secondly, modern slavery often involves violence and life threats, where perpetrators hold enslaved individuals as prisoners (Sakamoto, 2006). This is supported by empirical evidence, such as Chimeli and Soares (2017), which found that the shutdown of the mahogany market increased homicides. Additionally, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence which indicates how violence is used in the illegal mahogany market, with loggers having access to illegal weapons and frequently threatening those who resist the logging. Therefore, the cost of committing further crimes is much lower in an illegal and unregulated market than in a legal one. </s>"

On the one hand, it is a country with a relatively high gender wage gap, especially at the bottom of the wage distribution. In 2014, the difference between the earnings of full-time employed men and full-time employed women amounted to 17.2 percent in Germany, placing it in the upper third of countries with the highest gaps, above the OECD average (see Fig. 1a).2 At the first decile of the wage distribution, Germany even shows a wage difference of 18.2% in 2014, placing it among the eight countries with the highest gaps among low-income earners, and well above the United States and the United Kingdom (see Fig. 1b). It is thus evident that Germany suffers from high gender wage discrepancies in an OECD comparison, especially among low-wage earners.3 On the other hand, Germany introduced a nationwide minimum wage in 2015, which was set at a comparably high level and had only few exemptions.4 With € 8.50 gross per hour, it ranked among the highest wage floors in Europe in terms of purchasing power (Caliendo et al., 2019). Its level is to be re-evaluated every two years, and it was increased to € 8.84 in January 2017, being followed by additional increases in 2019 and the subsequent years (Mindestlohnkommission, Mindestlohnkommission, Mindestlohnkommission). Caused by its high initial value, the reform affected about four million employees, i.e. about ten percent of the eligible workers (Destatis, 2016). Among them, women were vastly overrepresented, since they accounted for two-thirds of affected employees (Burauel, Caliendo, Fedorets, Grabka, Schr?der, Schupp, Wittbrodt, 2017, Mindestlohnkommission). This has been attributed to insufficient regulations of the low-pay sector and gender segregation, which lead to an unequal coverage of collective bargaining agreements for men and women (Grimshaw, Rubery, 2013, Herzog-Stein, Lübker, Pusch, Schulten, Watt, 2018). Accordingly, the introduction of the wage floor could have an influence on gender inequality. In a simulation study, Boll et al. (2015) predict that in the absence of job losses, the minimum wage could reduce the average gender wage gap in Germany by 2.5 percentage points; and with job losses, the effect could even be larger. This points to a potential caveat, namely that low-paid women quitting or losing their jobs could cause a decrease in the gap. However, since all ex-post evaluation studies find only small employment effects and no strong evidence of gender-specific job-losses (see, e.g., Bonin, Isphording, Krause, Lichter, Pestel, Rinne, Caliendo, Obst, Preuss, Schr?der, Grabka, Caliendo, Schr?der, Wittbrodt, 2019, Pestel, Bonin, Isphording, Gregory, Caliendo), this does not seem to be an issue in Germany. </s>"

Willingness to pay (WTP) for well-being frequently depends on factors that enter the utility function directly (e.g., the probability of mortality, school quality, local crime rates, etc.) and compensatory investments that help to determine these factors (Grossman 1972). In a wide variety of contexts, the empirical literature has almost exclusively focused on the direct effects (e.g., health outcomes) of these factors and left the defensive investments largely unmeasured. As examples, there has been little effort to measure: the use of medications or air filters to protect against poor air quality (e.g., Chay and Greenstone 2003; Currie and Neidell 2005); parental expenditures on supplemental tutoring to improve educational outcomes for their children; or the costs of alarm systems and additional security to protect against crime.  </s>"

Driven by a new round of technology, the integration of traditional finance and technology continues to deepen, and financial technology emerges as the times require. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) defines financial technology as financial innovation enabled by technology. Moreover, financial technology can create new financial models and products, and reshape financial operation processes and applications, thereby having an important impact on financial markets, financial institutions and financial operations. Compared with traditional finance, with the empowerment of big data, cloud computing, blockchain, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and other technologies, the service efficiency of financial technology has been significantly improved. Moreover, the financial transaction boundary of financial institutions expands outwards and has significant decentralization characteristics [1]. Its innovative advantage lies in breaking the time and space limitations existing in the traditional financial model, getting rid of the constraints of physical outlets and manual services on financial services, and greatly reducing the cost of financial services, search costs and matching costs. Therefore, financial technology has the characteristics of inclusive finance, that is, ""financial services are available"", ""financing is available"" and ""financial infrastructure is universal"" [2]. However, the essence of financial technology is still finance, and its core function is still resource allocation. It uses modern Internet technology to innovate financial models and improve the efficiency of financial services. Therefore, financial technology also has financial risks, and compared with traditional financial models, in addition to traditional financial risks, there are also technical risks caused by technological empowerment. </s>"

First, there is larger scholarly impact, in terms of citations, from Henderson et al.

Two caveats to that potential advantage are that night lights do better at predicting differences in economic variables over space than changes in those variables over time (Nordhaus and Chen, 2015; Goldblatt et al., 2020; Gibson and Boe-Gibson, 2020), and the time-series is old, with DMSP data stopping in 2013 while VIIRS data are available monthly with only a slight lag.3 Also, economists may have more slowly switched to using VIIRS night lights data, compared to other disciplines, because flaws in DMSP data are rarely highlighted in the economics literature. The remote sensing literature has several comparisons that highlight the superiority of VIIRS (e.g. Elvidge et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2014; Chen and Nordhaus, 2015, 2019) but these studies are rarely cited in economics journals. </s>"

A broad range of studies have highlighted the adverse effects of air pollution on many outcomes, including crime (Burkhardt et al., 2020; Herrnstadt et al., 2021), labor productivity (Borgschulte et al., 2022) and other human behaviors (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2009), in the short and long run (Archsmith et al., 2018). More recent evidence in eco nomics demonstrates that exposure to air pollution can have adverse effects on the development of cognitive function and exacerbate the expression of anti-social behaviors associated with violence (Burkhardt et al., 2019; Sager, 2019; Walters, 2014). Accordingly, the possible underlying mechanism is that air pollution may alter the emotional disposition or risk preferences of individuals via some biological processes. Because of China’s extreme emphasis on maintaining social stability (i.e., “stability trumps everything” said by Deng Xiaoping), engaging in social conflicts, even for wage disputes, becomes a risky action. Thus, risk preferences, if associated with air pollution, could serve as a promising channel through which individuals’ decisions to participate in risky actions, such as social conflicts, may be affected. Individuals with increased risk preferences, under the influence of air pollution, may be more prone to being triggered. Thus, we first turn to the previous literature on medical and public health to reveal plausible mechanisms to establish the causal link between pollution exposure and social conflicts.

The medical and public health literature shows that air pollution might cause a series of physiological effects, which plausibly increase aggressive behaviors and contribute to violent crimes. For example, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can directly trigger an inflammatory response in the central nervous system (Block and Calderon-Garcidue ′ nas, ? 2009), which is closely linked with aggression, anxiety and depression (Herrnstadt et al., 2021) and even lead to criminal or violent activities (Lu et al., 2018). Long-term exposure to particulate matter and ozone is closely associated with reduced pulmonary function (Xu et al., 2021). Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin, reducing the amount of absorbed oxygen and impairing coordination and cognition (Amitai et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2018a). Furthermore, pollution exposure may result in various biological outcomes, as documented in the medical literature (Herrnstadt et al., 2021), including elevated levels of stress hormones (Li et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2013), reduced perceived control, increased impulsiveness, and changes in certain personality traits, such as time preferences (Lu et al., 2018; Power et al., 2015; Riis-Vestergaard et al., 2018; Sass et al., 2017). The latter outcome, i.e., time preferences, is related to the perceived risks and payoffs of violent behaviors (Bondy et al., 2020). In summary, if such pollution-related biological mechanisms are at play, exposure to air pollution, even in the short term, could be biologically linked to aggressive behaviors, eventually leading to increased social conflicts. In economics, several studies have explored links similar to those discussed in this paper, revealing potential mechanisms that may be at play. For instance, Sager (2019) demonstrates that how these channels can impair cognitive skills involved in driving performance, resulting in a 0.3–0.6% increase in the number of road traffic accidents per day for each additional 1 μg∕m3 of PM2.5 in the United Kingdom. Burkhardt et al. (2019) find that a 10% increase in same-day exposure to PM2.5 and ozone is associated with 0.14% and 0.3% increases in violent crimes, respectively. Moreover, exposure to air pollution could also be linked to negative emotions, which could underlie aggressive behaviors. For example, Zhang et al. (2017) show that air pollution reduces hedonic happiness and increases the rate of depressive symptoms.

It represents distinctive characteristics that, ceteris paribus, can determine the success or failure of a firm compared to its peers (El-Bannany, 2008). In the knowledge-based socio-economic period where IC is considered as one of the production factors, it is not surprising that IC has been much[1]received attention from many researchers from different disciplines, especially management, accounting, and finance. While several studies have attempted to define IC from a theoretical perspective (Bontis, 1998; Wu & Tsai, 2005), others have developed effective measures of IC-based performance (Pulic, 2000) or explored the relationship between IC efficiency and some key characteristics of firms, industries, and regions (El-Bannany, 2008; Liang et al., 2011). The last strand focuses on empirically examining the effect of IC efficiency on financial performance. Despite many studies on this strand, there are a limited number of studies that attempt to test this link in the banking sector. It is acknowledged that the banking industry is one of the most knowledge-intensive industries (Firer & Mitchell Williams, 2003; Mavridis & Kyrmizoglou, 2005) and represents an ideal setting for research on IC. One may argue that banks may gain valuable competitive advantages by tightening their relationship with their customers and making valuable investments in soft information production (Boot, 2000). Other studies however emphasize that an efficient IC is more important for achieving success in banking than other industries since the higher quality of products and/services offered to customers depends on the bank’s investments associated with IC such as human resources, brand building, systems, and processes. Hence, banks should manage their IC as efficiently as possible. </s>"

With the development of technology and increasing social awareness of responsibility, CSR has been increasingly regarded as a vital competitive strategy for firms to mitigate risk (e.g., Godfrey 2005). Nevertheless, whether idiosyncratic risk (IR) in stock prices—an important financial indicator accounting for 85% of total risk (Goyal and Santa-Clara 2003)—can be reduced by engaging in CSR activities remains unclear. Notably, IR is the volatility of a company’s stock price caused by specific events (e.g., oil spills or labor strikes) that mainly influence only that company (Bansal and Clelland 2004, Luo and Bhattacharya 2009). Different from IR (or unsystematic risk), systematic risk refers to the sensitivity to deflation, exchange rate adjustment, and other common market changes that can affect all stocks (Luo and Bhattacharya 2009), and it accounts for the rest of total risk (15%). As such, investors and managers are more concerned about IR than about systematic risk. In particular, as IR is an important component of shareholder wealth (Srinivasan and Hanssens 2009), investors are more willing to choose stocks with a lower IR than those with a higher IR. Managers also care about IR, as companies with high IR often have difficulty in obtaining a stable cash flow and in developing new businesses. This may influence their ability to service debt and thus lead to company failure (Bansal and Clelland 2004). Therefore, IR is a vital risk that firms must consider and we focus on how CSR influences firm IR. </s>"

Currently, approximately 70,000 multinational personnel, also known as Blue Helmets, are deployed in 12 operations across the world, tasked with maintaining or enforcing peace. Despite facing a persistent shortage of resources and the failure to protect civilians in some emblematic cases, such as Rwanda, large-N studies demonstrate that peacekeeping has a positive effect on reducing violence in ongoing civil wars and the likelihood of conflict reoccurrence, even in the most challenging contexts (e.g., Beardsley 2011; Bove et al., 2020; Di Salvatore and Ruggeri 2017; Hegre et al., 2019; Hultman et al., 2013; Ruggeri et al., 2017). Peacekeepers also contribute to household well-being by revitalizing economic exchanges, promoting labour market participation, and building confidence and trust (Beber et al., 2019; Bove and Elia, 2018; Bove et al., 2021; Carnahan et al., 2006; Caruso et al., 2017; Cil et al., 2019; Nomikos 2022).1 The presence of peacekeepers has also a positive effect on maternal health outcomes, reducing maternal mortality rates and increasing access to services and education for women (Gizelis and Cao 2021).

UN peacekeeping missions are crucial in ensuring that basic public services, including medical services, are available and accessible by vulnerable populations. This is due to the security they provide. In addition, they oftentimes directly provide essential healthcare equipment and products.2 Indeed, contemporary UN interventions are not limited to keeping the peace – they aim at building sustainable and long-term peace (Campbell and Di Salvatore, 2023).3 This implies that the presence of UN peacekeepers not only offers a reduction in violence, but also the security umbrella essential to the provision of and access to basic public services and to the revival of the local economic activites. This article focuses on how peacekeeping operations, by enabling NGOs and governments to function more effectively and promoting revitalization of economic activities, are expected to affect fertility rates. Indeed, this enhanced peace provided by UN interventions creates a qualitative difference from post-conflict settings where peace is present but access to services may still be lacking. </s>"
