Finding_II:The APRP has successfully facilitated a shift from the agricultural sector to the non-agricultural sector, thereby addressing the problem of low productivity in rural areas.
Finding_III:The APRP has shown positive average treatment effects on participating households' economic outcomes, with households receiving housing vouchers experiencing different effects compared to those moving into public housing communities. </s><s>Assistant: 7：
In addition to a positive ATT, we document substantial heterogeneity in the effects, which aligns with our conceptual framework predictions. First, we find that the treatment effect on economic outcomes is smaller for households receiving housing vouchers than those who moved into public housing communities. This heterogeneity can be explained by the fact that households who chose housing vouchers had more kids and relocated to places with better access to educational resources. Higher amenities compensate for wage differences, encouraging some households without a comparative advantage in the non-agricultural sector to participate in the program. Second, moving into public housing communities has no significant positive impact on the labor supply of those with relatively low potential income in the labor market, including women, those who did not work in the previous year, and those with severe health issues. Heterogeneous effects on different groups of people are consistent with the Roy-model perspective, according to which comparative advantage in the non-agricultural sector determines the gain in potential income.

Notably, identifying the critical mechanism that decreases the switching cost from the agricultural to the non-agricultural sector with a short-distance relocation is the primary objective. We exploit the variation that participants who move to the same relocation community may come from different villages. For households in the same relocation community, access to the labor market, geographic conditions, transportation, etc., are all the same after treatment. Variations come before relocation, which is exogenous to households because selfrelocation across villages is rare among poor households. Also, any?effect of belonging to a particular village is eliminated by comparing participants and non-participants in the same village. Pre-treatment environment determines how restricted and isolated the Identified Poor Households (IPHs) are. With this variation, we find that households from villages with a lower average income, a lower proportion of wage in household income, and a more rugged terrain benefit more from relocation. Overall, access to non-agricultural sectors before treatment, which is in turn affected by geographic conditions, determines the treatment effect. We exclude some potential mechanisms, including extra job opportunities provided post-treatment, exposure to wealthier IPHs, and improved housing quality.

Finally, we conduct a cost–benefit analysis of the APRP by comparing the fiscal expenditure of the program with the increase in participants’ life-cycle potential income. A back-of-the-envelope calculation denotes that the APRP generates a net benefit to the economy when the counterfactual per capita income growth rate exceeds 6.45%. Our estimate likely underestimates the long-run benefit on the next generation (Chetty et al., 2016; Chyn, 2018), as we estimate the short-run effect of the program, given data limitations. Besides, the distributional benefit of the APRP, which is potentially substantial, is not considered. Future research is required </s>"

Finding_II:Competition for resources among armed groups leads to an increase in violence.
Finding_III:The capacity effect of an additional armed group on political violence is negative, but armed groups can compensate by altering their strategies. </s><s>Assistant: 6：
We estimate that an additional active armed group increases the quantity of political violence between 50% and 80% and the severity of violence (the sum of individuals wounded or killed) between 50% and 100%. The results suggest that the competition effect (for publicity, recruits, and/or financing) between armed groups dominates on average in our setting. Concerns about unobserved confounders explaining the UBA formation are relatively small since the general goals, target audience, primary opponent, and tactics of the BLA and UBA are similar.5 Moreover, we do not find evidence that our results are driven by infighting between armed groups, increased counter-insurgency efforts by the government, changes in politically disenfranchised populations, or local financing opportunities.
7：
Taking our analysis to the group level, we leverage the UBA split from the BLA to (i) test for the capacity effect experienced by the BLA and (ii) investigate how the BLA allocates its attacks in response to increased competition. We show that the BLA primarily conducts additional attacks in districts in which other groups, as well as the ?UBA, are active. Hence, we can rule out that increased violence is driven by competition between the BLA and UBA alone. Moreover, we document that the BLA conducts more non-capital intensive attacks following its split, which provides suggestive evidence that the split is indeed a negative capacity shock. However, the fatalities inflicted by the BLA, both in absolute terms and relative to other groups operating within the same district, do not decrease. Hence, the BLA seems to be able to compensate for the negative capacity effect by switching strategies, which is in line with theoretical predictions of Bueno de Mesquita (2013). </s>"

Finding_III:The study provides evidence that domestic violence may be expressive behavior, originating from individual experiences in the past. </s><s>Assistant: 10：
Our central result is that a man ’s exposure to wartime sexual violence against women as a soldier significantly increases his pro pensity to commit violence against a female intimate partner more than a decade after the end of the war and, on average, about 18 years after exposure. We contend that this effect is not driven by local effects, omitted individual variables, measurement error, linear model specification, mis-specified inter-correlations in the error term or the choice of our preferred instrumental variable specification.

We present empirical evidence to argue that the underlying mechanism is a lasting reduction in self-control, fostering more impulsive and automatic responses to critical situations with their partner. Surprisingly, we find no support for alternative theories based on living up to norms of gender, social models of violence, distress or a reduction in economic bargaining power, which have dominated explanations of intimate partner violence in across disciplines. Our findings are consistent with an interpretation of IPV as ‘expressive’ behavior, where men intrinsically value the expression of violence and violent acts may arise as an unintended outcome. </s>"

Finding_II:Job-seekers revise their beliefs about employment prospects based on search experience.
Finding_III:Reducing transport costs can lead to job-seekers settling for lower-paying jobs in their own township. </s><s>Assistant: 6：
We find that providing job search subsidies reduced search costs as participants in the treatment group searched more intensively than those in the control group, by travelling more frequently and by covering a wider geographic area in the job search. This occurs even when the subsidy is unconditional and does not need to be spent on travel, suggesting that the job-seekers genuinely believe that transportation is a constraint. We then find that job-seekers who travel more intensively in search of jobs revise their beliefs in line with their search experience: treated job-seekers update their beliefs about their employment prospects, leading to a decrease in salary expectations (5%) and in reservation wages (8%). They revise downward the probability of getting a high-paying job in the city and they report a significant increase (23%) in their valuation of existing jobs, measured by the expected number of days job-seekers think it would take for them to find another job, if they were to lose the one they had. Finally, in line with their downgraded beliefs, job-seekers were more impatient (a 15% change relative to the control group) and more likely to search in their own township relative to the control group (by a factor of 2). This redirection of search towards the township results in them being 9% percentage points (a 77% change relative to the control at endline) more likely to settle for a lower-paying job in their own township, despite having reported a preference for a job in the city centre at baseline. This effect is driven primarily by the 64% of job-seekers who at baseline held strong beliefs about the importance of travelling to prospective employers and dropping their CVs as an effective job search strategy.9 Jobs in the township are even scarcer than in the city centre and those in the control group who manage to search unsubsidized in the city centre are positively selected on skill and are more likely to be male so levels of actual employment end up being similar across treatment and control groups twelve months after the start of our intervention. The main difference is that those who settle on a township job are paid less and wages increase much more slowly for jobs in the township, so our (rough and ready) calculation suggests that this switch may come at a very substantial loss of life-time earnings.
7:Our findings reveal that imperfect information about employment prospects and on how to find a job is pervasive and that because information is multi-dimensional, it is hard to correct through increased access to the labour market alone.11 In environments characterized by high transport costs to areas where the good jobs are located, many jobseekers believe that their best strategy is to apply in person whenever they have a chance. But temporarily reducing transport costs to give them a chance to apply may not improve employment outcomes, while also potentially leading to the wrong lesson being learned. When the external access constraint is lifted, job-seekers search intensively, but given that jobs are scarce and job-seekers may be mistargeting, many of them will find that jobs fail to materialize immediately. The inference from this experience depends on their priors. In particular, if they start by believing that there are enough jobs and that the key strategy to find them is to travel to the city centre and leave CVs with prospective employers, then the failure to find their desired job after searching intensively might lead them to blame their own lack of skills or to grow impatient with the search process. These are, in fact, the patterns we observe in the data. This implies that policies to support job-seekers in low-income settings characterized by significant spatial asymmetries of information might need to include de-biasing interventions alongside investments to increase access to the labour market, so as to optimally guide job-seekers in the job search and mitigate mistargeting (Altmann et al., 2018). </s>"

We find no effect of calls by either private or government teachers on mathematics or language test scores. This is robust to controls for student characteristics and school fixed effects, and differences in survey mode (in-person or phone). We do find some positive effects of tutoring calls on educational engagement by parents and children. Tutoring calls increase an index of student activity by 0.29 standard deviations and an index of parent activity by 0.27 standard deviations. Within this index, however, we see no statistically significant effect on the probability that children listened to educational radio, and only a 4 percentage point increase (significant at the 10 percent level) in the probability that their parent knew the correct FM frequency.
6：
Re-enrolment was over 99 percent even in the control group, so we see no effect of calls on re-enrolment. Private school teachers (who were directly managed by the project implementer) did exert greater effort than the government school teachers. Private school teachers placed 59 percent of planned calls, compared to 41 percent for government school teachers. But this extra effort did not translate to any difference in student outcomes. This lack of a difference in outcomes across implementers – despite a difference in implementation fidelity suggests that the null finding results not from an implementation failure but in the effectiveness of the intervention itself. Many students did not listen to educational radio at all (43 percent in the control group and 34 percent in the treatment group), so low uptake of the educational radio is potential part of the reason for a lack of impact on student learning. </s>"

Finding_III:Improvements in road access without extension support can lead to reduced cultivation and a shift to non-farm occupations. </s><s>Assistant: 4：
Combining administrative geo-spatial data with large agricultural surveys and using a generalized difference-in-difference (GDD) strategy that exploits the staggered roll out of the roads and extension, I find that, while ineffective in isolation, extension and roads have complementary effects on agricultural productivity. I show that in villages with access to both extension and roads, farmers are more likely to use agricultural advice, credit and modern inputs. In addition, farmers specialize in crops and trade across villages in line with their relative advantages with respect to access to markets and technologies. In the villages that get a road without the technologies provided under extension, households reduce total area cultivated and are more likely to shift to non-farm occupations. While extension and roads increase farm income on average, the improvements are concentrated in the villages that have access to both factors.
5：
The results on the strong complementarity between extension and road are robust to exhaustive checks. While the baseline analysis defines road access based on whether the village is intersected by a road, the main findings are similar when using a market access measure that takes into account the full road network and the distribution of population in all Ethiopian villages. I also find that the main results are similar when considering a second identification strategy that combines the GDD design with an instrumental variable for market access based on least cost predicted network that aims to isolate the exogenous variation in market access induced by regional budget constraints and topography. Furthermore, I show the results are robust to alternative definitions of extension access, accounting for the confounding effects of correlates of access to road and extension or alternative estimation strategies that address the limitations of the main two-way fixed effect specification. </s>"

Finding_II:The Total Sanitation Campaign led to a significant increase in sanitation ownership among households active in the marriage market
Finding_III:The policy resulted in a redistribution of gains across matched types, with a higher marital match surplus for couples where men are wealthier than women </s><s>Assistant: 6：
Our estimates provide interesting insights into the determinants of the marital surplus that drive individuals to sort into marriage relative to remaining single. We show that the marital surplus from sanitation increases with the wealth of the household and varies with the wealth of the couple. This suggests that taste and household demand for sanitation vary with the couple’s wealth level. In other words, having sanitation in the marriage is not universally more attractive than an arrangement without. We then use the estimated model to conduct a structural policy evaluation of the TSC to assess whether the policy alters the marital surplus and the division of the surplus.
7：
The evaluation highlights three main findings. First, we document a significant increase in the marital surplus due to TSC exposure. In other words, a decrease in the price of sanitation, a household public good, increases the gains from the marriage that a couple receives relative to singlehood. This increase in marital surplus is consistent with the change in marriage behavior — having sanitation makes it more attractive to be in a marriage for both men and women, inducing some to marry. The increased pool of potential partners leads to changes in sorting patterns. Second, the change in marital sorting results in a redistribution of gains across matched types, namely a higher marital match surplus for couples where men are wealthier than women and a lower marital match surplus for most remaining cases. Third, the policy also reallocated gains within a marriage, where some of the gains in toilet accessibility were redistributed to men, away from women, through the marriage equilibrium process. It is important to note that our results do not imply that the women are necessarily worse off ex-post TSC exposure. The total marital utility is higher, and so in equilibrium, we see more marriages and, thus, the entry of men and women. However, the division of this additional marital utility is not necessarily equal among partners, which is demonstrated by analyzing TSC’s impact on the wife’s surplus share. </s>"

In the medium term, the effect of the monetary reward dissipates relative to the comparison group, while the effect of the public commitment treatment persists.

Finding_III:However, the mental well-being of elderly parents, especially mothers, is negatively impacted by having fewer children. They receive less companionship from children and are more likely to experience depression. </s><s>Assistant: 5：
Using three waves (2011, 2013, 2015) of the panel data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), our empirical analysis suggests that China’s family planning policies have different effects on parents’ physical and mental well-being. Regarding their physical well-being, we find that parents with a greater exposure to the family planning policies do not reduce household expenditures. Using a wide range of indicators, we find no evidence that parents’ physical health status would deteriorate as a result of longer exposures to LLF. In contrast, the prospect of elderly parents’ mental well-being is not so optimistic, especially for mothers. Parents receive less companion from children as a result of having fewer children. We also find that women more exposed to the family planning policies are more likely to be depressed. Our findings may be related to China’s high elderly suicide rates (ESR), which are found to be four to five times higher than the general Chinese population and more than twice the global average (Li et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2019). Why are the effects of family planning on the elderly’s physical and mental well-being so different? Our theoretical framework offers some rationales to this stylized fact by assuming (1) the mental well-being of the elderly is more sensitive to children’s psychological support than to the financial support, and (2) there exists no technology that can “save” children’s companionship. Whereas parents can save their earned income when they are young to prepare for old age, they can never “save up” children’s companionship. The findings in our study thus call for greater attention to the elderly’s mental health. </s>"

Finding_II:The trade-off between lives and livelihoods varies by income, with poor countries valuing lives relative to income more than rich countries.
Finding_III:Optimal policy in poorer countries becomes more strict due to the recognition that foregoing short-term consumption may be a question of survival for poor households. </s><s>Assistant: 5:
The model highlights two important points. First, recognizing that foregoing short-term consumption may be a question of survival for poor households has somewhat counter-intuitive implications for policy. Because both infected and susceptible agents, who are pushed close to their subsistence constraint will remain economically active in the face of infection risk and even government containment policies, optimal policy in poorer countries becomes more rather than less strict. Second, comparative statics illustrate that any statement about the desirability of laxer lockdowns in poorer countries is highly sensitive to the VSL and how it changes with income.
6：
Next, we examine how pandemic outcomes and policies varied by income and infection fatality rates (IFR) for 125 countries through the lens of this model. We find, for instance, that, relative to rich countries, poor countries had slightly stricter containment policies during the first year of the pandemic (i.e. before vaccines arrived), but nevertheless experienced smaller drops in economic activity. They also saw higher infections yet fewer deaths. On the other hand, countries with low IFR display laxer containment policies, lower economic contractions, and less excess mortality despite higher infection rates.
7：
We then use indirect inference to estimate the unobserved subsistence constraint and income elasticity of the VSL that produce a close match between data and model in the difference in pandemic outcomes across rich and poor as well as high- and low IFR countries. The model successfully matches the data with an income-elasticity of the VSL which is strictly less than unity – implying the value countries place on lost lives increases less than proportionally with income – and a subsistence constraint that is strictly greater than zero. The value for the income-elasticity of the VSL is in line with estimates in Viscusi and Masterman (2017) who suggest an income-VSL elasticity between 0.8 and 1.2, and lines up with recent cross-country estimates of the incomeelasticity of health expenses (Farag et al., 2012). A positive subsistence level is consistent with a lower elasticity of substitution between labor and consumption at low income levels (see King et al. (1988)) that is commonly found in historical data (Ohanian et al., 2008; Bick et al., 2018; Boppart and Krusell, 2020). </s>"

Finding_II:Exposure to land expropriation increases the probability of having conflicts with local government officials by about 2.5%.
Finding_III:The adverse political impacts of land expropriation are not persistent and can be mitigated by sound local governance and the generation of public benefits. </s><s>Assistant: 8：
I begin by estimating the overall political impacts. The empirical finding is that if households have directly experienced land expropriation, both political beliefs and political behavior of individuals in these households are affected. Specifically, exposure to land expropriation decreases individuals’ trust towards local government officials by 0.07 standard deviations, which is equal to about 36% of the mean difference in political trust between individuals with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) membership and those without. In addition, exposure to land expropriation increases the probability of having conflicts with local government officials by about 2.5%, compared to a sample mean of 5%, which means it increases the incidence of experiencing conflicts with government officials by around 50%. These adverse effects imply that expropriating land is indeed politically costly for local governments. The results are robust to a variety of internal validity checks.
9：
The empirical analysis also yields three important findings, which further have some important political implications. First, the dynamic estimates show that the effects on both political outcomes are not persistent, instead, they eventually attenuate to zero about four years after treatment. Second, I do not find statistically significant spillover effects, suggesting that the control group of non-expropriated individuals is not affected by the expropriation of the land of their neighbors. Last, individuals subject to expropriation also negatively assess government service and quality, but the effects are significant and remarkable only in the short run. Taken together, these results suggest that the adverse political impacts are not persistent and restrictive to those affected only. In other words, to some extent, land expropriation in rural areas may not pose a fatal threat to China’s political regime.
10：
The Wukan example is by no means the only way in which how land takings occur in China. It epitomizes the worse possible features of land seizures (i.e., low compensation, no ex-ante negotiation, corruption, abuse of enforcement, no public benefits). Arguably, the outcomes could be different if the expropriation does not occur in that way. For instance, one may ask what would be the consequences if the projects are well managed and justified by local governments and/or the land is taken for public use (e.g., expressways and high-speed rail). To this end, I next turn to consider the role of compensation in determining the political effects, and the extent to which the adverse political impacts depend upon governance quality, the public benefits of projects, and the importance of the agricultural land for affected households.
11：
Of course, many factors could intermediate the relationship between land expropriation and political outcomes. I provide four insights into this link. First, I provide evidence that households’ economic wellbeing is not significantly affected by land expropriation, given that (i) land expropriation does not create negative shocks to total household income,8 and (ii) saving asset (bank deposits and cash) of affected households increases, even though it is not persistent. However, compared to the market value of the land, the compensation is very low, indicative of an uneven redistribution of land rents between farmers and local government and property developers, which is likely to be perceived by farmers as unfair. This view is supported by a comparison with urban housing demolition which produces large, positive wealth shocks to affected households and has no impact on political outcomes.9 Second, I find that the adverse political impacts can largely be avoided by sound local governance as reflected by (i) availability of information?about the expropriation projects at the village level, (ii) high government transparency level, and (iii) low government corruption level. Third, the political costs also can be reduced or even eliminated in villages that experience infrastructure improvement (e.g., gaining access to roads and railways or providing electricity or tap water) during the same period when villagers have their land expropriated. Last, the adverse political impacts are less salient for households with at least one member working in the non-agricultural sector before having their land expropriated. In other words, the political costs appear to arise mainly from perceived unfairness of compensation and nontransparent governance and can be reduced when projects generate public benefits or households depend less on agriculture. </s>"

This paper examines the effects of a public policy implemented in Egypt during the 1960s and 1970s to increase access to higher education through the construction of a public university in each province (governorate). To investigate the policy’s impact, we leverage the staggered roll-out of the university construction across the country. We merge data on the time of university construction in the province where individuals attended compulsory school with individual-level data on education, labor, and marriage outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that the establishment of a local university significantly increases the?likelihood of higher education attainment among the exposed cohorts by 2 percentage points, a 12% increase relative to the unexposed. Additionally, we observe that the policy’s impact is more prominent among women, with exposed women displaying a 4 percentage point higher probability of receiving higher education, a 29% increase compared to unexposed women

The construction of a local university has positive longer-term implications for labor market outcomes, benefiting both genders in terms of improved job quality, with a significant increase in the probability of engaging in high-skilled and top-management occupations. However, the policy’s impact was stronger for women. The cohorts exposed to the local university displayed a 3.9 percentage point increase in female labor force participation, a 12.8% increase relative to the unexposed. Additionally, the probability of paid employment among women increased by 3.1 percentage points, representing an 11.7% increase. The policy also impacted marriage outcomes for women, as the exposed cohorts showed a reduction of 0.73 years in the age gap between spouses and a significant increase in the probability of marrying a highly-educated husband, indicating strong assortative mating based on education. Furthermore, affected women were 20% less likely to marry at a young age (before age 18, incl.), exhibited higher levels of intra-household decision-making autonomy, and delayed fertility.
4：
We provide suggestive evidence on the role of migration as a channel for explaining our results. We show that constructing a local university in an individual’s province is associated with a delay in migration age. The share of people migrating before (or at) the age of university enrollment decreased sharply in response to the policy, and the share of those migrating after that age increased significantly. This pattern of migration delay holds true for the two genders, however, it hides variations regarding the reason for migration.
5：
The decline in the before-18 migration for education purposes is more evident among men, suggesting that internal migration for study prevailed as a channel for obtaining higher education among men prior to local university construction. Exposed men were also less likely to migrate for work before age of 18. For women, exposure to local universities reduced the share of migrating for early marriage. This suggests that higher education came as an alternative to early marriage which adds to the improvements in women’s decision-making autonomy and marriage outcomes that we observe in our results. After 18, both genders exposed to local universities are more likely, relative to the unexposed, to migrate for work and marriage. Overall, our results suggest that access to higher education increases mobility and widens the scope for economic opportunities for both genders and the scope for social empowerment among women. </s>"

Moreover, since China’s opening policy commenced and a few decades of economic reforms have occurred, private firms have become an important component of the national economy. According to the latest statistics based on the annual surveys of industrial firms in China, domestic private firms account for more than 75% of all enterprises and contribute about 60% of China’s employment and output.8 With this representative sample of Chinese firms, we find that the firms more affected by the intensified import competition do not alter their state ownership but relatively increase their foreign ownership compared with the less affected firms. The magnitude of the increaseis considerable. A one-standard-deviation increase in the shock intensity is associated with a relative increase of 0.03 standard deviations in foreign ownership ratio, which accounts for 11% of its sample mean. If we consider firms in the top versus bottom decile of the trade shock, those more shocked by the trade liberalization increase their foreign ownership more than those less shocked by an amount accounting for 24% (7%) of the sample mean (standard deviation).

We explore the heterogeneity of firm responses along theoretically motivated dimensions. First, we examine how firm responses vary between regions with different economic conditions and institutional environments. We find that the baseline patterns of change in foreign ownership are mainly concentrated in more developed regions, as characterized by greater regional gross domestic product (GDP), higher household consumption, and better infrastructure development, and in regions with better functioning markets and institutions, which feature less government intervention, less local protectionism, more mature legal systems, and stronger support for innovation compared with other regions. Second, we explore two potential channels through which foreign shareholders can help firms respondto competitive shocks. First, we find that comparedwith other firms, those in industries with a larger innovation gap relative to the international technology frontiers and?with greater reliance on labor versus physical capital have more incentives to introduce foreign shareholders because they can benefitfrom the adoption of advanced technologies through the participation of foreign investors. Second, we use US industries as the benchmark and compare firms in industries with more versus less dependence on external finance. We find that firms with greater financing needs do indeed have a greater relative increase in foreign shareholders than firms with less dependence on external financing. This result lends support to the financing channel, which suggests that firms sell their equity to foreign investors to circumvent financial constraints. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the strategic role of ownership in strengthening the competitiveness of firms and suggest that product market competition is an important force in ownership dynamics. </s>"

We evaluate the impacts of the AWIS intervention on three families of outcomes, eight to twelve months after implementation. First, we evaluate effects on knowledge about WASH and MHM practices among male and female students, male and female teachers, and headteachers, and institutions for WASH service management. For five out of six outcomes, we see small to medium improvements (between 0.1 and 0.3 standard deviations). Not all the individual effects are statistically significant and none independently survive corrections for multiple hypothesis testing that control the family-wise error rate. However, this pattern of consistently positive results is unlikely to have occurred due to chance (p=.031).
6：
Second, we turn to material effects on WASH provision and use. We measure effects on three outcomes: the number of functioning toilets available to students; a toilet quality index, which summarizes measures of functionality, cleanliness, and hygiene; and latrine use. We develop a novel approach to anonymously measuring latrine use, using discreet magnetic door sensors that record when the latrine door is opened or closed. The characteristic signature of a latrine use event in these data is an interval during which the door is closed bookended by two intervals during which the door is open. Door sensors present a potential improvement over other alternatives such as motion sensor cameras, because the entire equipment can be installed outside the cubicle, minimizing intrusion of privacy. We estimate effects on WASH provision and use separately for toilets used by male and female students. We also report the number of functioning toilets available to all students (for which use is not gender-separated), although few schools have them. Three out of seven metrics show statistically insignificant improvements, and four show declines. We thus find no evidence that?the intervention improved WASH service provision or increased WASH facility use.
7：
Most disappointing, the impacts on WASH provision and use are negative for all metrics for toilets available to female students. We did not design our experiment to detect negative effects of the intervention; we prespecified one-sided hypothesis tests to maximize power, given the limited sample size. However, two out of three of these negative effects are statistically significant at the 10 percent level in two-sided hypothesis tests, a pattern of results with a low likelihood of occurring if the intervention had no effect on school WASH services. WASH provision and use for female students decline in treated schools relative to control schools not because WASH service provision worsens in treated schools but because control schools more successfully improve WASH service provision. Future research should investigate whether similar interventions can have negative unforeseen discouragement effects, for example by creating expectations of future external material support that disincentivize independent local action.
8：
Finally, we turn to effects on school attendance and exam results. We do not find that the intervention leads to measurable changes in attendance or achievement in exams. The 90% confidence intervals exclude increases in female student attendance larger than 4.1 percentage points (p.p) or declines larger than 2.9 p.p. and increases in female student exam results of greater than 0.16 points on an 5 point scale or declines larger than 0.12 points. For female students, baseline mean attendance is 66% and the mean exam score is 2.3.5 That the intervention does not measurably affect attendance or results may not be surprising, given the mixed results on knowledge and institutions, and WASH provision and use.
9：
Although the number of schools in the study is relatively small, we maximize our ability to detect effects by collecting rich data at a more granular unit or temporal level wherever feasible. Conversely, we minimize the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions by using randomizationbased inference and reporting conservative multiple hypothesis tests that control the risk of erroneously rejecting any of the null hypotheses within a family of outcomes. Ex post minimum detectable effects using measures of the variance of the estimated coefficients (that are independent of the realized point estimates themselves) suggest that the study was powered (at significance level 10% and power 80%) to detect increases in indexes of between 0.2 and 0.4 standard deviations, typically characterized as small to medium-sized effects (Cohen, 1988). Thus the reason we do not detect effects on WASH service provision is not solely a consequence of power. Adherence to the study protocol was also high, with all schools assigned to treatment successfully treated. </s>"

It is worth stressing, that by using the number of murders as one of the proxy for violence helps in addressing issues of under-reporting which might be present for less extreme acts of violence.3 To clearly identify the mechanisms that explain such results is challenging. From existing evidence and some novel results we suggest that female mayors have an increased attention to policies that might favor women welfare, however we do not find clear evidence that female mayors are more likely than men to introduce women’s shelter or women police stations, policies that are managed and implemented by state governors. </s>"

By investigating child death rates, I test whether the underlying mechanism is that changes in health services disproportionately favored highest birth order girls. I do not find that high birth order girls, amongst children who have survived infancy, have different survival rates during early childhood than girls in general, suggesting that health services remained constant across birth orders. I also test the claim that female leaders directly reduced sex selection fertility services by investigating the impact of female reservations on sex ratios across different socioeconomic statuses. Studies have shown that the use of sex selective abortions is most common amongst more educated women, and less educated women do not appear to rely on abortions as a method of sex selection (Jha et al., 2011, P?rtner, 2016). Thus, restriction of fertility services should more directly impact more educated women. I find that the effects in this paper are strongest for poor and illiterate women, suggesting that the restriction of fertility services likely does not explain the results. Rather, because the least educated women do not rely on abortion as a means to sex select, the reduction in sex ratios documented in this paper is likely driven by increased survival of high birth order girls.
8：
While the main analysis in the paper exploits state-level variation in the timing associated with an increased total level of female leadership within a state, I also investigate if female headship at the district-level Panchayat explains the reduction in high birth order sex ratios in rural areas. I find that the effect is not explained by female headship at the district-level Panchayat, suggesting that female leadership at lower-level Panchayats (the village or the block level) is likely driving the results. Surprisingly, however, I also find that female headship at the district level reduces high birth order sex ratios in the urban population within the district. This is unexpected as the amendment affects local-level government for rural, and not urban, India. I argue that there are reasons to believe that exposure to district-level women leaders is more prominent in urban towns due to the location of district-level offices and media exposure. Consistent with exposure to women leaders being the mechanism, I find that seat reservations for women at the district-level Panchayat decreases the high birth order ratio of boys in areas where exposure to district Panchayat leaders is arguably high, but not in the areas where the Panchayats target their goods and services. </s>"

We find that the presence of a female leader in Brazilian Municipalities had a negative, sizable, and significant impact on the number of COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations per 100 thousand inhabitants. Our results show that electing a woman as a mayor causes a decrease from 46.9 to 51.0 COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100 thousand inhabitants, which represents 30.4 to 33.0 percent of the outcome average among the municipalities that elected a man. Similarly, we document a drop of 21.7 to 25.5 COVID-19 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants decreases in municipalities that elected a woman, around 37.2 to 43.7 percent of the outcome average among the municipalities that elected a man. We also show that electing a female mayor causes a statistically significant in the number of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) enforced in the municipality in 2020. In particular, we show that female leaders are more likely to adopt mandatory use of face masks and forbid gatherings. In contrast, we do not find evidence that women increase investment in health care neither before nor after the pandemic outbreak. Finally, we show that these effects are stronger in municipalities where voters are more supportive of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who openly disavowed vaccines and NPIs during the pandemic. This finding exemplifies the role local leaders can play in counteracting bad policies implemented by populist leaders at the national level.

One possible concern is that mayors’ characteristics that are relevant for policymaking could be driving our results (Alesina et al., 2019). In particular, the fact that female mayors tend to be more educated in Brazilian municipalities could be an issue (Arvate et al., 2017). We show that, in fact, there is a small and non-robust unbalance in both years of education and ideological preferences between female and male leaders. In order to verify if these characteristics are driving our results, we show that our findings do not change after accounting for them in our regressions. This suggests that the difference we document is likely driven by differences in non-observable traits between female and male leaders.

In addition, we also analyze reelection outcomes. We find that female mayors are less likely to be reelected compared to their male counterparts. We interpret our findings as showing that, despite being more corrupt, male mayors are more likely to be reelected due to their involvement in patronage and their ability to attract more campaign donations. We provide evidence that is inconsistent with some of the alternative explanations.
5：
The main goal of the paper is to provide novel rigorous evidence about how the gender of the policymaker affects corruption. We rely on an objective measure of irregularities in government contracts and purchases, which comes from administrative data from a federal anti-corruption program in Brazil. Starting in 2003, the federal government began to randomly audit municipalities to detect administrative irregularities in government contracts and purchases. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that links the gender of the policymaker to objective data on irregularities in government contracts and purchases, instead of relying on survey measures as the extant literature. We find that the probability of observing a corruption episode is between 29 and 35% lower in municipalities with female mayors than in those with male mayors.
7:
We also analyze campaign contributions, as political donations are considered to be one of the main ways through which private interests gain influence over elected officials. The main objective of campaign finance regulations is in fact to prevent political corruption (Ansolabehere, 2007, Strauss, 1999).2 Several papers suggest that in Brazil, political campaign financing is a crucial mechanism through which firms establish political connections. Corporations can make cash donations to candidates or party campaign funds, with a maximum of 2% of their previous year's gross revenues, although off-the-books contributions are also quite common.3 Empirical studies have found a significant relation between corporate campaign donations and firm profitability, access to financing, and the probability of receiving government procurement contracts (Bandeira-de Mello and Marcon, 2005, Claessens et al., 2008, Boas et al., 2014). We find that female mayors that run for reelection receive fewer campaign contributions than male mayors running for reelection.4 This may be consistent with our corruption results, to the extent that male mayors may be more likely to manipulate government procurement processes to favor firms that donated to their campaigns.
8：
When analyzing electoral outcomes, we find that female mayors who are eligible to re-run have about 20 percentage points lower probability of being reelected compared to their male counterparts.5 We also find that there is no gender difference in the probability of re-running. Overall, we interpret our findings as showing that, despite being more corrupt, male mayors are more likely to be reelected due to their involvement in patronage and their ability to attract more campaign donations.
9：
Providing conclusive evidence on the link between patronage, campaign donations, and reelection strategies is tricky, because the gender of the policymaker may affect many policies, some of which are potentially unobservable.6 To provide more evidence in line with this interpretation, we consider and rule out alternative explanations. One potential alternative explanation for our reelection finding is that, despite being more corrupt, male mayors may be doing better than female mayors in some policies or may provide more public goods, and this explains their higher reelection probability. However, the great majority of evidence from other countries supports the view that female politicians do a better job than male politicians in providing public goods.7 Whether similar results hold in the Brazilian context is an empirical question
10：
To analyze this alternative mechanism, we study differences across genders in the ability to attract intergovernmental transfers and in the provision of key public goods that depend on the municipal administration: health and education. First, we look at total discretionary transfers for capital investment. In Brazil, the effort of the mayor is one of the main determinants of the amount of these transfers. Second, we analyze health outcomes, focusing in particular on health care services related to prenatal care delivery.8 We focus on prenatal care outcomes because, to the best of our knowledge, these are the only health outcomes readily available at the municipal level and the evidence suggests that they tend to respond quickly to changes in policies (Fujiwara, 2015). Additionally, we focus on educational inputs for which data at the local level are readily available: the fraction of schools in a municipality that have certain facilities (library, science lab, and internet). Our results show that, if anything, women do a better job at attracting transfers and providing public goods. First, we find that female mayors attract about 60% more transfers for capital investment than their male counterparts. Second, our results show that having a female mayor seems to lead to better health outcomes related to prenatal care delivery. Third, female mayors seem more likely to head municipalities with better educational facilities, although the differences are small and statistically insignificant. This suggests that gender differences in the quality and quantity of public goods are unlikely to offer an alternative explanation to why men are more likely to be reelected.
Another potential alternative explanation for our findings is that men and women face different electoral opponents when they run for reelection. This may happen, for instance, if, after a mixed gender close election, the electoral strength of the incumbent is perceived to be gender dependent. For instance, female incumbents may be considered weaker, and thus they may attract more opponents or different opponents. We look at whether the number and education of opponents to female incumbents differ from those of the opponents of male incumbents. Our results are inconsistent with the importance of such a channel.

Finding_II:Women in former British territories of Cameroon have higher control over household resources and property ownership compared to women in former French territories.
Finding_III:Women in former British territories of Cameroon face a higher risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) compared to women in former French territories. </s><s>Assistant: 5:We present five sets of results. First, we show that the British colonial rule had a two-sided legacy for women that is still visible today. On the one hand, there remains a persistent impact of the historical Anglo-French border on female participation in the labor market. In particular, women in former British territories have a 24 percentage points higher propensity to be in paid employment than their counterparts in former French territories. In terms of magnitude, this is a large effect considering that the mean female paid employment rate throughout the examined region is 62%. Consistent with the British colonizer effect on female employment, we find that women on the British side of the border are also more empowered in terms of control over household resources and property ownership. On the other hand, we estimate that women on the British side of the historical border face a 10 percentage points higher risk of (past year) spousal violence than their counterparts on the French side. Just as the border effect on female paid employment, this effect is large in magnitude as it compares with a mean prevalence of IPV of 28% throughout the region examined. We demonstrate that the magnitude and precision of these estimates are robust to several alternative specifications.

6：Second, we ask if the two colonizer effects on female employment and IPV are explained by the same or two different subsamples of women.  The latter is a possibility as the partition of Cameroon and its later reunification induced a multiplicity of treatments: besides its impact on women's economic opportunities, the identity of the colonizer has likely affected many dimensions of life in Cameroon, some of which might be relevant for domestic violence in isolation. We show that the two separate border effects on female employment and IPV are not explained by two separate subsamples of women, with one subsample driving the employment effect and the other driving the IPV effect, but by the same subsample of women.  In order words, those women who, due to the legacy of British colonial rule, are more likely to be employed are also those who experience an increased likelihood of being victims of IPV.

7:Third, we conduct supplementary analyses to explore some possible explanations for our findings. The result that the British colonial rule caused a persistent increase in both female employment and IPV, and that these two effects are driven by the same subsample of women, is inconsistent with household bargaining models. These models predict that increased economic opportunities for women reduce IPV by leveling the balance of power between partners (Aizer (2010)). By contrast, our results are consistent with theories of male backlash, whereby men resort to violence when their partners’ economic opportunities increase, in order to reinstate a culture of male authority and control over women. Supporting this interpretation, we show that women of the British side of the historical border have a 12 percentage points higher propensity of having a partner who objects to their employment, and that this effect is entirely explained by the subsample of women driving the British colonizer effect on female employment and IPV.

8：Fourth, while the evidence we provide is suggestive of male backlash (i.e., a causal chain from British colonial rule to higher female employment to increased IPV risk), there might be colonizer effects on third factors driving female employment, domestic violence, or both. Thus, we explore observed individual and household level factors that the literature highlights as such potentially important drivers: male employment, male occupation, male alcohol consumption, education, number of children, age, practice of polygamy, and exposure to conflict. Our RD results show that these factors vary smoothly at the historical Anglo-French border.

9：Fifth, a potential concern with the interpretation of our results arises if self-reporting of IPV is affected by women's empowerment and, in our setting, by different colonial practices in the past. It could be argued that empowering women changes their attitudes to gender equality and, hence, increases the likelihood of reporting IPV in their daily lives. Agüero and Frisancho (2017) use an experimental approach based on indirect questioning techniques to assess the extent of truthful IPV reporting in the DHS. They find no evidence of IPV misreporting for low-educated women, but highly educated women appear to underreport IPV victimization. This suggests that, if anything, empowered women—i.e., those who do not fit the typical victim stereotype—face larger disutility of being exposed as victims and therefore underreport IPV. Building on this finding, if IPV reporting of empowered women is a threat to our interpretation of the results, we would expect a positive individual level correlation between IPV and different measures of female empowerment other than employment. Multivariate regressions based on our estimation sample show this not to be the case: there is a negative correlation between domestic violence and a woman's education, which is inconsistent with the notion that IPV reporting increases with a woman's empowerment. </s>"

Finding_II:The reform intensified son preference in fertility, leading to an increase in excess infant mortality among girls
Finding_III:The reform did not significantly change patriarchal norms, as evidenced by no significant impact on co-residence with sons or distance of married daughters' homes from their natal home </s><s>Assistant: 8：We use the three available rounds of nationally representative individual level data from the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) pertaining to births between 1972 and 2004. We find a significant decrease of 3.8–4.3 percentage points in the probability that a girl is born post-reform and post-ultrasound in households where the firstborn child is a girl rather than a boy. This magnitude of decline is outside the biologically normal range.4 In Section 5.1, we put it in perspective, comparing with other studies and with rates of ultrasound scan use.

9：Our finding that female foeticide increased in response to inheritance reform is robust to the inclusion of state-year of birth fixed effects. These mop up variation in state-level pro-female legislation that may have coincided with inheritance reform, for instance the establishment of Women's Commissions (discussed in Anderson and Genicot, 2015). This is a relevant concern given that India has a federal system and a number of states have, at different times, implemented laws designed to limit the extent of sex-selective abortion (Sekher, 2012). State-year fixed effects also absorb the effects of economic influences on the desire for sons such as the increase in returns to education for girls relative to boys, as well as account for any differential state-level pre-trends in the outcome. Our results are also robust to controlling for mother's age and mother fixed effects, which absorb all mother-specific time-invariant variables including unobservables such as her preference for sons or her fertility preferences (as well as, of course, observables such as her education, caste and religion). The mother's preferences may determine compliance and thus including mother fixed effects will adjust for any changes in the composition of women giving birth post-reform. In addition, our results are also robust to using an alternative dataset (REDS, 2006). Additional robustness checks are discussed in Section 5.2.

10：The most plausible interpretation of our finding is that in the presence of sticky social norms, awarding inheritance rights to women makes parents more averse to having a daughter rather than a son.5 In line with this, we also find an intensification of stated preferences for sons relative to daughters after the reform of approximately 1 percentage point following the reform, compared to a sample mean of 0.57. Our findings are consistent with the theoretical framework of Botticini and Siow (2003).

11：In research conducted in parallel with ours, Rosenblum (2015) shows an increase in excess girl mortality (after birth) following the inheritance reform.7 We focus on female foeticide as it is a particularly clean indicator of parental preferences for boys over girls – it involves an explicit decision to conduct prenatal detection of the sex of the child, and this needs to be followed up by the deliberate act of aborting the foetus if it is a girl. However, we also extend our analysis to study impacts of the reform on excess infant mortality among girls, and on son-biased fertility stopping. We find that the reform exacerbates son preference on both these margins.8 In particular, girls born post-reform and post-ultrasound in families with a firstborn girl are 2.3–3.2 percentage points more likely to die before their reaching first birthday (equivalent to 32–42% of the sample mean), relative to boys. Moreover, children in families with firstborn girl are approximately 9 percentage points more likely to have a younger sibling (equivalent to 12% of the sample mean), relative to families with firstborn boy. Together with our sex ratio results, these findings provide compelling evidence in favour of our contention that the inheritance reform intensified son preference in fertility.

12:A natural question at this point is: if what we capture is a sticky social norm, do we find any corroborating evidence in support of this claim? In order to examine changes in patrilocal norms in response to the reform, we investigate co-residence of parents and adult sons and the distance of married daughters' homes from their natal home using a different dataset: the Rural Economic and Demographic Survey (REDS) 2006. We estimate an increase of 3 percentage points in the probability that a married daughter lives nearer the natal home (up to 10?km away), but this is not statistically significant. We also find no significant impact on the extent of co-residence with sons. Together, these results suggest that patriarchal norms change only very slowly if at all, so that a sharp legislative change intended to favour daughters appears to have raised the perceived cost of daughters enough that parents became more averse to having them. </s>"

Finding_III:Political reservations have led to a significant increase in women's entrepreneurship in India. </s><s>Assistant: 4：Our empirical strategy follows Iyer et al. (2012) by using differences in the timing of the implementation of reservations across Indian states. We conduct a panel analysis at the state-industry level that allows us to exploit this state-level timing variation and differences in traits across industries. Industries are defined at the three-digit level within the manufacturing sector. Empirical results yield a mixed message regarding the extent to which these reforms improved women's participation in the workforce. On one hand, we do not identify that women's employment in manufacturing increased after the implementation of reservations. This limited response is true in both the unorganized and organized sectors, is observed in multiple datasets, and it holds for employment in both female- and male-owned establishments.

5：On the other hand, we find significant evidence that women's entrepreneurship in India increased with the implementation of political reservations. This increase occurs with a state-level timing that follows the implementation of the reservations, and the growth persists even after controlling for contemporaneous male entrepreneurship by state-industry. We also show that the state-level timing of the implementations was not linked to pre-existing differences in entrepreneurship by state, further adding to the plausible exogeneity introduced by Iyer et al. (2012), and that there is no evidence of pre-trends in the age structures of women-owned manufacturing businesses in 1994. We describe below, however, some important limitations in the degree to which we can fully measure pre-trends, with our evidence often being indirect.

7：We further investigate the channels through which this entrepreneurship flourishes. The heightened start of women-owned establishments is concentrated in industrial sectors in which women have traditionally owned establishments. Equally as important, the greater entrepreneurship is mostly concentrated in household-based enterprises, rather than establishments opening as independent facilities.

8：We then discuss the potential channels through which this effect occurs, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence. We do not find much evidence that the entrepreneurship is linked to changes in reporting or to greater access to government-sponsored contracts and business. Likewise, improved financing conditions appear to play a modest role, as the increase in female-owned loan-holding establishments is weaker than the total effect registered and suggests that financing accompanied the increased entry rather than caused it. We then discuss how entry patterns could be consistent with increases at the local level of public goods and infrastructure favored by women (e.g., Besley et al., 2004, Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004a, Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004b, Pande, 2003) or greater aspirations of women towards entrepreneurship (e.g., Beaman et al., 2012). We discuss how these stimuli could have produced the industry patterns observed, to the extent that women entrepreneurs built upon sectors where women have traditionally been active (e.g., Ghani et al., 2013b) and at a household-based scale of operation that was feasible to achieve. </s>"

Most importantly, our results show that the new environmental regulations have led to significantly lower levels of employment in the manufacturing sector in regulated areas: employment in treatment firms fell by 3% relative to similar firms in nonregulated areas, which is similar to the existing findings on the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments (Greenstone, 2002). These results suggest that a 1% reduction in SO2 emissions will lead to a 0.13% decrease in labor demand. Additionally, we find that low-skilled labor and workers in domestic firms are more likely to lose their jobs under environmental regulation in China.Environmental regulations have also increased labor productivity, which may be due to the effects of improved technology. Using the WTO accession as the external shock, we further prove that technology upgrading could be skill increasing and thus labor-saving. </s>"

Spatial inequality is understated by DMSP data, especially in the urban sector. </s><s>Assistant: 4:In the main part of the paper we report on the relationship between night lights and Indonesian GDP at the second sub-national level for 497 spatial units. The DMSP data do not appear to be a suitable proxy for GDP outside of cities, with a negative relationship between DMSP lights and the real GDP of non-urban spatial units, while VIIRS data positively relate to GDP. The negative lights-GDP relationship is especially for rural areas of low population density, in line with the conclusion of Chen and Nordhaus (2011) that luminosity data do not provide reliable estimates of economic activity for low output density regions. A related finding with cross-country data comes from Keola et al. (2015); DMSP night lights negatively relate to GDP if agriculture is a large share of GDP, while there is a positive relationship otherwise. In Indonesia’s urban sector, the lights-GDP relationship is positive irrespective of the type of night lights data used, but the relationship is twice as noisy if the DMSP data are used rather than the VIIRS data. We also find spatial inequality considerably understated by the DMSP data, especially in the urban sector. A Pareto-based adjustment from Bluhm and Krause (2018) to deal with top-coding in DMSP data has a modest effect but the adjusted data still greatly understate spatial inequality, and miss much of the intra-city heterogeneity in brightness (coming from key economic facilities) for Jakarta.

5：Similar patterns are evident for the other two countries we study. Spatial inequality is understated if the DMSP data are used as a proxy for local economic activity, especially in the urban sector or in higher density regions. Night lights data have higher predictive power for sub-national GDP when working with more aggregated spatial units, such as provinces, while the gap between DMSP and VIIRS in terms of predictive power gets wider for analyses based on smaller or lower level units within the administrative hierarchy. The data for China allow us to compare lights-GDP relationships in the primary sector with those in industrial and services sectors and this comparison shows that night lights data are a poor proxy for primary sector economic activity. Overall, our results suggest that great caution is needed if development economists use night lights data, not only for low density rural areas but also when studying the spatial patterns of urban development. </s>"

Finding_II:Climate change has a more negative impact on agricultural yield than on TFP in China.
Finding_III:Adaptation behaviors in response to climate change have been observed in all three inputs (labor, fertilizer, and machinery) in Chinese agriculture. </s><s>Assistant: We combine the strength of existing literature to investigate the nonlinear relationship between agricultural TFPs and variation in temperature and other weather variables. This article follows two representative approaches introduced by Schlenker and Roberts (2009) in panel regressions: 1) a simple piecewise linear function of temperature and construct the variables of growing degree days (GDDs) below and above a selected threshold and 2) more specific temperature bins that calculate the accumulation of heat for each 3–6?°C temperature interval.The simultaneous variations in additional weather variables, such as rainfall, sunshine duration, humidity, and wind force are also taken into account (Zhang et al., 2017).Panel estimates suggest that piecewise linear function yields results similar to those estimated using more complicated functional forms. An increase in exposure to temperatures above 33?°C results in sharp declines in agricultural TFPs. We use the same methods to evaluate the impact of climate change on yield (measured by unit land output value) and find it to be more negative than the impact on agricultural TFP, as we expected, since extreme hot weather may also lower input utilization in the short run. Applying the same approach, we find evidence that labor and fertilizer usage is indeed significantly reduced with an increase in exposure to high temperature.
To investigate whether longer-term adjustment to climate change has significantly exceeded shorter-run adjustment, we follow Burke and Emerick (2016) to compare the panel estimates with the long differences estimates. Long-run adaptations appear to have mitigated 37.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3%–54.8%) of the short-run impacts of extreme heat exposure on China’s agricultural TFPs. In terms of yield, 46.8% (95% CI, 30.2%–58.0%) of the short-run effect is offset in the long run, which is larger than the offset in TFP, implying the existence of adaptation in input usage. Comparing the panel estimates with the long differences estimates of inputs, we find that adaptation indeed occurred in all three inputs. The negative impact of climate change in labor and fertilizer is smaller, and a positive effect on machinery is found in the long run, indicating that farmers use more machines to replace labor when the weather gets hotter. This finding provides new evidence for the induced innovation theory proposed by Hayami and Ruttan (1971).
Our findings remained remarkably robust when alternative methods to merge climate and agriculture data, alternative temperature bins, alternative productivity measures, and alternative estimation strategies are adopted. Using the estimated coefficients, together with different future climate change scenarios, we further projected the effect of future warming on China’s agriculture. China’s agricultural TFP is projected to decline by 2–6% by 2050 and by 4–12% by 2070 under the global climate models HadGEM2-ES and NorESM1-M. The decline in agricultural yield is projected to be nearly twice as large as the reduction in agricultural TFP in the future. Although climate adaptation is occurring, future global warming is still expected to make a significant negative effect on China’s agricultural production. This effect is likely to increase in the long term, relative to the midterm. This means that the earlier the mitigation actions are taken, the better the policy effects will be. </s>"

Finding_III:Large noncompliant firms upgraded their abatement technology in response to green credit regulations, while small noncompliant firms reduced production due to higher loan costs. </s><s>Assistant: 6：
We then employ a difference-in-difference strategy to examine the impact of green credit, conditional on the environmental law compliance status of borrowers, on the loan costs and on firms' economic and environmental performance within the context of a prominent increase in enforcement stringency of the Chinese green credit regulation in 2012. Basically, our baseline results reveal that, after 2012, strengthened green credit regulations explain 10.2% of the increase in the floating ratio of the loan rate for firms with noncompliance records relative to their law-abiding counterparts.3 Later, we demonstrate the robustness of our results by conducting several tests to address potential endogeneity issues. Moreover, we study the heterogeneous effects across different types of firms. We find the effects to be more pronounced for privately owned firms (POEs). Additionally, small firms with records of noncompliance with environmental regulations saw a larger increase in the interest rate after 2012. In addition to the above intensive margin effect, we also find out the extensive margin effect, that is, strengthened green credit regulation impedes non-compliant firms’ access to loan.
7：
Finally, we assess the impact of green credit regulations on firms’ operations and emissions. To better explore the underlying mechanism, we consistently take firm size into account. We find that large punished firms experience a relatively smaller decrease in liabilities, compared with small punished firms. Their total assets, fixed assets, investments, and operational performance, including sales and employees, are also less negatively impacted. However, there is no observable difference pertaining to the impact on profits of firm varied by their sizes. When it comes to the environmental performance, although all of these firms reduced their pollution emissions, how the reductions were realized is dissimilar: large firms place a large proportion of their investment into emission control by, for example, adopting more abatement facilities, while small firms simply choose to produce less. Stated differently, upon the green loan regulations, the large noncompliant firms responsively upgrade pollution cleaning technology thus turning green; while small noncompliant firms are forced to produce less due to less loans with higher costs. In a certain sense, financial markets are able to internalize the potential adverse costs of environmental fines on the margins of a borrowing firm. And it would be seen as a sound complementary mechanism to administrations, especially in countries with limited government capacity. </s>"

The analyses yield several main results. First, the enforcement of more stringent fuel standards significantly improved air quality. The average pollution across all pollutants was reduced by 12.9%. The progression from a lower to a higher standard led to an average fall of 9.4 μg/m3 in the concentration of PM2.5. Reassuringly, the long-run policy effect implied by the RD estimate aligns well with that from the DD estimate. Such improvement points to the importance of fuel standards in mitigating vehicles' environmental adversities.

Second, there are some intra-day fluctuations, but these are well explained by the atmospheric chemistry of the pollutants, ensuring the credibility of the main results. Overall, local governments' environmental protection efforts appear to be an important institutional factor in enhancing the environmental benefits of a higher fuel standard, suggesting their importance in China's decentralized system of environmental governance. The new standards are more effective in cities with more active government pollution reduction efforts.
10：
Third, a back-of-the-envelope analysis further suggests that the net benefit of adopting the new gasoline standard is significant, at US$26 billion annually. Using health-based studies of particulate air pollution from China, the improved air quality generates US$21.44 billion annually in health benefits from reduced mortality and US$8.65 billion annually in health benefits from reduced morbidity. The upgrading involves a cost increase (measured at consumer prices) of about US$3.99 billion. </s>"

Finding_II:Dowry payments increase in response to adverse rainfall shocks.
Finding_III:Shocks in agriculturally important periods of rain drive the increase in dowry deaths. </s><s>Assistant: 2：Specifically, we estimate how dowry deaths in individual Indian districts respond to plausibly exogenous local precipitation shocks in a given year. Using the conditional maximum likelihood (also called quasi-maximum likelihood, or QML) estimation method proposed by Hausman et al. (1984) to estimate fixed effects models with count data, we find that a 1 standard deviation fluctuation of rainfall below its long-term mean results in a 7.8 percent increase in dowry deaths and a 4.4 percent increase in domestic violence, controlling for district and year fixed effects. These findings are robust to the inclusion of district-specific time trends and the exclusion of big cities and potential outliers.

3：We posit that a consumption smoothing mechanism drives these findings, and we present evidence that supports this hypothesis. First, using a dataset collected from a subset of the districts, we show that dowry payments increase in response to adverse rainfall shocks. Second, we show that the incidence of dowry killings in response to shocks is much lower in areas where dowry would be less prevalent due to differences in cultural norms. We also show that shocks in agriculturally important periods of rain drive our results.

9：An important limitation of our work is that we observe reported crimes, which are the product of two events: occurrence and reporting. Drèze and Khera (2000) point out that murders are very difficult to hide. Furthermore, as described below, Indian law mandates post-mortem examinations in the deaths of young women under a broad set of circumstances, further reducing the likelihood of underreporting. In addition, dowry deaths are reported by the family or friends of the deceased women, who are less likely to be influenced by social norms and fear of retaliation than the women themselves. However, we cannot rule out that reporting is also responding to shocks. If dowry deaths are generally underreported, then our estimates are lower bounds of the true effects. On the other hand, if shocks lead to overreporting—for example, if families report dowry deaths in adverse circumstances to extract compensation for withdrawing the case—then we would see an upward bias in our results. Using aggregate statistics, we show that the percentage of case withdrawals is extremely small and cannot be driving our results. We also show that incidence of dowry deaths is lower in districts where dowry prevalence is likely to be lower. This further suggests that our results cannot be driven by reporting changes alone. </s>"

Finding_III:Fishers located downstream of the contaminated zone experienced a more negative impact, with their average income reduced by more than half in 2016. </s><s>Assistant: 3：We estimate the impact of Formosa by employing a series of difference-in-differences estimations (DiD) using individual-worker data, and show that the disaster sharply reduced average fishery income by as much as 42 percent during the rest of 2016. Utilizing high-resolution, satellite-detected data on the prevalence of night-time fishing boats at the monthly interval, we additionally estimate the direct impact of Formosa on fishing activities, showing an average decline in fishing intensity of as much as 36 percent in the period immediately following the pollution breakout. Importantly, we find a large spatial variation in impact's magnitude. Our estimation indicates a more negative impact on fishery communities located downstream of the contaminated zone relative to those upstream and closer to safe waters. In addition, we show that the heterogeneous impact seems to have induced different labor-market coping responses. Satellite data suggests a strong northward movement in the fishing pattern of the affected upstream fishers. Being able to travel to safer fishing grounds allowed these workers to maintain the number of work hours. In contrast, fishers located downstream were more likely trapped inside the contaminated zone; their average income reduced by more than half in 2016. This adverse circumstance led to a significant reduction in fishery work hours and an increase in the likelihood of working secondary jobs. Quantile analysis further suggests a distributional impact across fishery income groups, indicating the strongest damage to fishers in the lowest income quantile.

4：Next, we study aspects of the disaster recovery by examining Formosa effects on both fishing intensity and fishery earnings over time. We find a gradual reduction in the size of disaster damage to both outcomes. Evidence shows that by the last quarter of 2016, while fishing activity in the affected region had largely recovered, average monthly fishery earnings were still only two-third of the pre-disaster period. Additionally, we examine potential spillover effects of Formosa to other related industries in the affected provinces. Among the industries deemed eligible for Formosa compensation by the government, we find positive earning spillovers to workers in the freshwater-fishery industry, especially those located downstream. Finally, in an extended discussion, we study the potential effect of the government's fishing-ban policy. Evidence from a spatial regression discontinuity design and a triple-differences analysis suggest some, albeit not statistically robust, effect of the ban, which aligns with our view that, rather than being strictly enforced, the ban served more as a mechanism through which the government communicated the severity of the incidence to the public. </s>"

Finding_III:Disaster aid plays an important role in financing the repression mechanism in storm autocracies. </s><s>Assistant: 10：Our empirical analysis corroborates our theoretical prediction that storm shocks cause a deterioration in democratic conditions. First, storms reduce the Polity2 measure of democracy in island countries by 4.25 percent in the following year. In a falsification exercise, we fail to find this adverse effect in an average landlocked or coastal country. Second, we estimate that governments restrict political rights following storms, which constitutes a critical mechanism from storms to a reduced level of democracy. This finding is consistent with the endorsement that the majority of citizens give to populist-autocratic leaders around the world. It also accords with milder forms of repression, such as militarization of the disaster response, given that countries are increasingly deploying their military to extend relief and assistance, at home and abroad (Weeks 2007). We also consider coups and national elections as alternative mechanisms but rule them out. Third, we show that disaster aid is likely to play an important role in financing the repression mechanism. Noting that our benchmark results exclude very large island countries such as Australia and Indonesia, our findings are robust to the use of alternative storm measures, controlling for potential spatial biases and other economic and political control variables as well as the “adaptation” effect to storms, and satisfying the parallel trends assumption. </s>"

Finding_II:African countries that were suitable for the cultivation of maize experienced larger increases in population density and slave exports after the crop was introduced.
Finding_III:The introduction of maize did not lead to economic growth or reduced conflict in Africa, and may have actually increased conflict by increasing slavery. </s><s>Assistant: 9：We find robust evidence in support of both parts of the Crosby-Curtin Hypothesis. Specifically, we find that African countries that were suitable for the cultivation of maize experienced larger increases in both population density and slave exports after the crop was first introduced into Africa. The estimates from our preferred specifications, which include controls for differential trends in European contact and climate, suggest that following the introduction of maize, a 1% increase in maize-suitable land is associated with a 0.025% increase in population density and a 0.024% increase in slave exports.5 These estimates imply that the introduction of maize during the Colombian Exchange played a significant role in shaping precolonial Africa; for the average country, nearly 22% of the population growth over the period 1600–1900, and 6% of the increase in slave exports at the height of the slave trades can be attributed to the introduction of maize.

10：The third, and final, step in our analysis is to ask whether the introduction of maize had effects on African societies beyond those envisioned by Crosby and Curtin. Our motivation for doing so stems from recent research that has shown that the introduction of New World crops during the Colombian Exchange (particularly, the white potato and sweet potato) increased economic growth (Nunn and Qian, 2011) and reduced conflict (Jia, 2014; Iyigun et al., 2015) in the Old World. In light of the evidence presented by Nunn (2008) and Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) indicating the slave trades negatively affected development in much of Africa, it is possible that the deleterious effects of increased slavery brought about by the introduction of maize may have been at least partially offset by the crop's effects on both growth and conflict. Using the same difference-in-difference strategy described above, we find little evidence that the introduction of maize increased economic growth or reduced conflict in Africa. Indeed, our estimates suggest that if anything, the introduction of maize may have increased conflict by increasing slavery.

11：Altogether, our estimates suggest that the introduction of maize during the Columbian Exchange played a significant role in shaping Africa's history by affecting population levels, slave exports and conflict. Affected African countries, however, were unable to utilize maize to escape the Malthusian trap. </s>"

Finding_III:The reduction of trade policy uncertainty is associated with more intensified industry-level competition, and new firm entry accounts for a significant portion of the incumbent productivity change. </s><s>Assistant: 3：In this study, we investigate how the TPU reduction associated with China’s WTO accession has affected new firm entry in China. Using firm registration data from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of China (SAIC), we collect panel data between 1998 and 2006 covering 318 prefecture-level cities and 30 two-digit manufacturing industries in China. Following Pierce and Schott (2016), we exploit the TPU variation across industries before and after China’s WTO accession to conduct a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation. Our results show that TPU reduction significantly promotes new firm entry. Specifically, shifting an industry’s TPU reduction from the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile increases its new firm entry rate by 3.31 percentage points, which is around 16.2% of the average annual manufacturing entry rate in our city-industry sample. //研究内容

4：We also shed light on the underlying mechanisms of the effect of TPU on new firm entry. First, a firm entry decision is made by comparing the present value of expected profits and the entry cost. When trade-induced uncertainty is reduced and expected future market conditions improve, potential entrepreneurs may find it profitable to start a new business. The extent of TPU’s impact on firm entry depends on the size and sunkness of the entry cost. Using a set of augmented estimations with triple interactions, we show that the marginal effect of TPU on entry is more pronounced in industries with lower entry barriers. Additionally, uncertainty is most relevant when the input is non-recoupable (Dixit et al., 1994, Folta et al., 2006), thus the impact of uncertainty on entry decisions hinges upon the irreversibility of the investment. Consistent with the literature that emphasizes firms’ wait-and-see strategy under uncertainty (Dixit, 1989, Stokey, 2016), we find that the TPU effect on entry is stronger in industries with larger irreversible investments. Second, export expansion and enhanced market access are likely to be key factors, as it is well documented that TPU reduction has been accompanied by exceptional export growth in China (Handley and Limao, 2017, Feng et al., 2017). We therefore seek to understand the extent to which the growth in new firm entry resulted from the exporting vs. non-exporting margins. Using the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) data, we find that the TPU effect is statistically significant for both exporting and non-exporting entrants, and that the magnitude of the former is 2.38 times that of the latter. Our results thus confirm the importance of export opportunity and market size expansion and point to the possible spillover to domestic non-exporting economic activities. Third, we identify the positive role of TPU reduction on regional agglomeration formation, which can further lower the cost of entry and foster new firm creation in the long run. This mechanism can be particularly important for developing economies in the early stage of industrialization. Last, TPU reduction and export opportunities may decrease entrepreneurial activities through an occupational choice mechanism (Díez and Ozdagli, 2020). As productive incumbent firms expand their production and exporting, labor demand and wage rates are likely to increase, which can discourage individuals from pursuing entrepreneurship. Based on the ASIF data, we find that incumbent Chinese manufacturing firms in high TPU reduction industries indeed experience a relative increase in employment size, but no statistically significant difference in wage rates. We discuss how the lack of an occupational trade-off channel may be attributable to the specific labor market conditions in China during the early 2000s. //机制研究

5：Furthermore, we evaluate the possible regional heterogeneity effects and find that the marginal TPU effect on new firm entry is more pronounced in cities with lower exporting costs or lower entry barriers, illustrating the complementarity between external opportunities and internal reform that has characterized China’s splendid economic performance in the post-WTO era. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that new firm entry plays a non-negligible role in understanding the association between trade and growth. In particular, since the induced entry is primarily attracted by the increase in expected future profits from the US market potentials, we show that the quality of new entrants is relatively higher in industries experiencing larger TPU reduction. Better-performing entrants exert a stronger selection effect by replacing inefficient incumbents and induce a more significant escape-competition effort among incumbents (Asturias et al., 2023, Aghion et al., 2009, Jiang et al., 2021). We report that TPU reduction is associated with more intensified industry-level competition, and that new firm entry can account for around 45% of the TPU-induced incumbent productivity change between 1998 and 2006. //异质性分析 </s>"

First, the adoption of PMC reforms reduces a county's GDP per capita by an average of 3.9%, which translates into a 0.44% drop in the annual growth rate. These findings indicate that in this context a flattened hierarchy is detrimental to economic performance.

The counties' fiscal revenue and transfers tend to increase after the elimination of the intermediate layer of city government in fiscal management. However, the enlarged span of control for the provincial government has weakened its monitoring and coordination capacity. In particular, total public expenditure and pro-growth investment in PMC counties have declined on average after the reform. More land was sold through negotiation instead of market mechanisms, and at lower prices in the affected counties, pointing to increased land corruption after the PMC reform. This, in turn, may have negatively influenced economic performance. These results demonstrate that such organizational change may well impose costs on the economies concerned that exceed the benefits, and they may also have implications for the design of an effective and productive organization.

Finding_II:The level effect of being close to transportation networks is positive, but not large.
Finding_III:The lack of factor mobility in China may limit the measured impact of better infrastructure. </s><s>Assistant: 7：The results show that being close to the line had a positive level effect. Per capita GDP was higher in places closer to the line. However, the effect is not large. The elasticity of per capita GDP with respect to distance from historical transportation networks is approximately ?0.07. The small level effect is consistent with independent data from a higher-quality household survey for rural areas, the National Fixed Point Survey (NFS) collected by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, which shows that distance has no significant effect on household income. For the estimates of the effect of proximity on growth, we find a precisely estimated zero effect. The estimated elasticity between distance to the line and annual per capita GDP growth is ?0.002 and statistically insignificant (the standard error is 0.003). Places close to the line grew exactly as fast as places further away.

8：Our finding that better access to transportation networks does not have a large impact on the (relative) economic performance of those areas is consistent with the Fogelian view that transportation infrastructure by itself does not contribute much to growth, excepting perhaps where there was already a demand for it. Based on similar logic, China scholars have criticized the tremendous amount of public investment in domestic transportation infrastructure after 1990 (Huang, 2008).

9：In assessing what general lessons one can learn from our results, one should consider whether our results are driven by conditions specific to the Chinese context. For example, one may be concerned that the marginal effect of access to infrastructure is especially low in China due to the massive public investment in infrastructure during recent years.3 We believe that this is highly unlikely to be driving our results because our data show large variation in access to infrastructure. The distance to the railroad for the counties that are the nearest the line (defined as the nearest decile) are only one-third of the distance of those furthest (defined as the furthest decile) from the line. Similarly, the nearest counties have more than twice the length of highway relative to the furthest counties (despite the fact that the latter are almost eight times as large). //局限性

10：Another concern for external validity is that the lack of factor mobility stems from the Chinese government's attempts to control labor mobility and that the empirical findings are not easily generalizable to the context of other developing countries.4 We acknowledge that the Chinese government may be unique in implementing an explicit policy for controlling migration for so long. However, it is important to note that the actual patterns of low levels of migration are not unique to China. In particular, the main policy effort has focused on unskilled low-wage rural workers (Meng, 2005), a group that has been found to be relatively immobile in other contexts such as in India (Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2009). Moreover, our simple theory predicts similar effects regardless of which factor (e.g., labor, capital) is immobile and the immobility of capital has been documented in several developing country contexts. For example, Chan et al. (2011) documents the immobility of capital in China during the period of our study. //局限性 </s>"

Finding_III:The number of historical missions in respondents' ancestral ethnic homelands is negatively associated with the likelihood of FGC, with one more mission per 1000 km2 decreasing the likelihood by 8 percentage points. </s><s>Assistant: The empirical results indicate that historical Christian missions did indeed have a long-run impact on FGC practices that persists to this day. The benchmark estimates suggest that a person living 10 km from a historical mission is approximately 4 percentage points less likely to have undergone FGC than someone living 100 km from a mission site. For respondents living in areas where FGC was practiced in pre-colonial times, the equivalent difference is 6 percentage points. The estimated effects are robust to a number of specifications and control variables.

To investigate potential mechanisms, we match our data on FGC and missions with granular geo-spatial data on night lights and on the size of urban agglomerations and use within-survey data on education, religious affiliation and urban residence. Controlling for these possible mechanisms has little impact on estimates. While we cannot provide direct evidence, this is consistent with an impact of missions on norms, which has then persisted. We also investigate the impact of number of missions in respondents' ancestral ethnic homelands. One more historical mission per 1000 km2 in the respondents’ ethnic homeland decreases the likelihood of FGC by on average 8 percentage points. The impact of missions in the ancestral ethnic homeland remains significant when we include missions in the geographic ethnic homeland where they currently live, arguably highlighting the role of intergenerational norm transmission within ethnic groups. </s>"

Finding_II:The positive effect on firm creation was short-lived and disappeared after two years due to increased uncertainty and political events.
Finding_III:Government initiatives such as tax cuts and community-driven development programs helped sustain the economic benefits of the peace agreement. </s><s>Assistant: Our findings are robust to a battery of tests, including the introduction of municipal and department-year fixed effects as well as controlling for differential trends parametrized by various pre-treatment controls. They are also unaffected by selecting the municipal controls with machine learning techniques to maximize their capacity to predict firm creation (Belloni et al., 2014) and their inclusion via inverse probability weighting (Abadie, 2005) or in a doubly-robust way (Sant’Anna and Zhao, 2020). The results are also unchanged to collapsing the pre and post-ceasefire periods to avoid serial correlation (Bertrand et al., 2004), to increasing the overlap between treated and control areas (Crump et al., 2009), to using different definitions of the treatment and the dependent variables, to restricting the control groups to areas affected by other guerilla organization with a similar ideology and tactics, and to performing a permutation test that randomizes the treatments across municipalities to obtain a distribution-free probability that our main result is driven by pure chance.

We also explore the characteristics of the economic dividend brought upon by the creation of new businesses in areas affected by FARC violence. To that end, we investigate the effect of the ceasefire on job creation, the size of the new firms, and their economic sector. Regarding employment, we document that incumbent firms in FARC-affected places do not experience any differential post-ceasefire change in the number of employees, as measured by two independent proxies. In contrast, new firms do differentially increase employment by a magnitude of between 20 and 30 percent. This suggests that the documented excess firm creation was concomitant with employment gains, rather than just triggering jobs reallocation from incumbent to new firms. We also find that the differential business creation takes place across the board, both in low value-added sectors such as agriculture and retail, and in sectors that entail higher value-added, investment and human capital such as manufacturing and tourism. However, most of the new firms created in FARC-affected areas are, at least in the short-run, micro businesses with low capital levels.

We further explore the extent to which key active post-conflict recovery programs implemented since 2017 amplify the economic benefits of the peace agreement. Conflict-affected places that benefited from either tax cuts targeted at the creation of formal employment or community-driven development programs experienced a post-ceasefire surge in firms’ creation that persisted after 2016. This implies that government initiatives have the potential to offset, at least partially, the uncertainty generated by the political turmoil around the implementation of the peace agreement.

Regarding the mechanisms, we provide both quantitative and qualitative evidence suggesting that the short-lived peace dividend was the result of political events that generated economic and political uncertainty. Indeed, Section 2.2 describes how some of the main institutional changes procured by the peace agreement were dismantled or threatened by the Colombian government, especially after the candidate whose main campaign promise was to end the agreement won the presidency in 2018. It also discusses how a faction of FARC sabotaged the agreement by re-taking the arms and returning to illegality, pledging a lack of commitment from the government to implement the agreed policies and institutional changes. Moreover, we document that conflict levels decreased in 2015 and 2016 but rapidly re-escalated since 2017, mimicking our findings regarding entrepreneurial activity. Finally, survey evidence that we analyze in that section suggests that these events negatively affected people’s optimism about the future as well as their perceptions about the improvement of security.4

To study the potential alternative mechanisms that could drive the post-ceasefire dynamics of entrepreneurship, we investigate the extent to which business competition explains the reversion in firm creation in the later post-ceasefire period. To this end, we look at temporal patterns of firm exit and find no evidence supporting this channel. We also explore whether pent-up demand in FARC-affected areas could explain the short-lasting economic recovery and we find weak evidence of this. As a third alternative, we test the hypothesis that all the observed firm entry is driven by the formalization of pre-existing businesses. We conclude this is unlikely the case. Finally, we look at the possibility that internal migration may explain our results and reject this idea. </s>"

Finding_II:There is a convergence in mobility when using measures sensitive to changes in education inequality across generations, but a divergence when using measures invariant to changes in inequality.
Finding_III:Girls are catching up to boys in intergenerational mobility in both developing and high-income countries. </s><s>Assistant: We obtain the following empirical findings. First, for the youngest cohort born between 1980 and 1989, intergenerational mobility is lower in the average developing country when compared to the average high-income country. This observation holds true for all six measures of mobility. Second, we observe a convergence in mobility when using measures that are sensitive to changes in education inequality across generations (inequality-sensitive measures), but a divergence in mobility when using measures that are invariant to changes in inequality (inequality-invariant measures) are used.

Third, regarding the relationship between intergenerational mobility and national income, we similarly observe two distinct patterns. Inequality-sensitive measures of mobility show a monotonically increasing relationship, while inequality-invariant measures show a U-shape-pattern with high levels of mobility observed among the richest as well as the poorest countries (arguably for different reasons).4 Fourth, Sub-Saharan Africa stands out as a region where children have been least successful at surpassing their parents' education, despite the comparatively low levels of parental education. In the poorest countries, the scope for surpassing parents is greatest but the capacity to educate children is lowest. By contrast, in the world's richest countries, the capacity to educate children is greatest but the scope to surpass parents is lowest. In other words, for two individuals with the same parental education background, it greatly matters what country one is born into, which sits well with Milanovic (2015).

Fifth, the world as a whole is notably less mobile than the average country in it. This underscores the importance of the country in which one obtains his/her education. We furthermore observe a modest upward trend in global mobility measured by inequality-sensitive indicators, while global mobility measured by inequality-invariant indicators is more stagnant. This empirical pattern is consistent with a decline in global inequality over time (Lakner and Milanovic, 2016). Sixth, when intergenerational mobility is disaggregated by gender, girls are found to be catching up to boys in the average developing country. Girls have already overtaken boys in the average high-income country for selected measures of intergenerational mobility and if current time-trends prevail, girls are on track for also surpassing boys in the developing world in the coming decade(s). </s>"

Finding_II:Moving from an area without TV to an area with TV lowered participation by 4 percentage points in pro-opposition polling centers in the repeat election.
Finding_III:Exposure to TV had no significant effect on the occurrence of protests between the two elections. </s><s>Assistant: First, I find no evidence that exposure to the signal changed voters’ likelihood of turning out in the first election — i.e. in normal times. However, it had a sizable impact on the repeat election. Based on the stark political divides across the territory, which largely interact with ethnic belongings (Horowitz and Long, 2016), I split the sample between polling centers that voted in favor of the opposition or the incumbent President in 2013. Strikingly, the sign of the estimates is opposite in the two political camps. In pro-opposition polling centers, moving from an area without TV to an area with TV lowers participation by 4 percentage points. Conversely, I find that TV has a positive and large effect on remobilization, ＋7 percentage points, among supporters of the incumbent and final winner of the election. Moreover, as the incumbent’s win margin in the previous poll increases, the effect of signal reception grows larger. The estimates suggest that a 10-percent increase in the incumbent’s score adds 1.5 percentage points to the baseline coefficient.

Turning to the possible impact of exposure to TV on involvement in the electoral protests, I find that it has no effect on average, but tend to decrease slightly the probability of conflict in the surroundings of pro-incumbent’s polling centers. Yet, I find no effect at the intensive margin, that this to say on the number of demonstrations.

These findings are corroborated with a series of robustness checks. The results are similar when the sample is restricted to areas that got access to the signal after 2016, which suggests that they are not driven by more urbanized places. This also indicates that the treatment effect is not contaminated by the larger penetration of the Internet and social media in bigger cities – in rural areas in 2016, 77% of the population never get access to news through the Internet (Afrobarometer) –, nor by the higher likelihood to be directly exposed to urban riots.2 Moreover, a placebo test confirms that the results are not spurious as I find no effect of being granted access to the signal in 2018, i.e. just after the 2017 election on mobilization.

In the last part of the paper, I delve into the potential channels of transmission and investigate various mechanisms that could account for the difference between the August and October elections, as well as the opposite effects in the two political camps. I argue that television played a predominantly informative role leading up to the repeat election. Given the unexpected decision by the Supreme Court and the exceptional circumstances surrounding it, voters required clear and comprehensive information to grasp the unfolding events and the need for a subsequent vote. Employing text analysis tools, I examine the content of news bulletins from the five most popular Kenyan channels and provide an overview of the TV coverage in 2017 and at the time of the repeat election. The analysis reveals a notable emphasis on the election, especially in the vocabulary employed, as well as a decline in the diversity of news topics covered, suggesting a significant focus on the prevailing context. Additionally, I document that the content heavily focused on protests and the climate of crisis. By comparing the impact of television exposure alongside physical proximity to the protests, I find no exacerbating effect of being in close proximity to demonstrations. Furthermore, exposure to protests without television does not significantly influence turnout, implying that the effect of television was primarily to disseminate information regarding the scheduling of the repeat election.

Furthermore, I explore the potential variations in editorial choices among different channels. This undertaking poses challenges due to the lack of reliable data on audience and viewership in Kenya. Computing the cosine similarity index between pairs of TV centers, I find that channels exhibited distinct editorial stances in 2016, i.e. prior to the start of the electoral season. However, in 2017, the cosine similarity matrix suggests a convergence among the channels, thereby reinforcing the notion of increased emphasis on the election. However, the state-owned station KBC TV stands out as the most distinct channel compared to others, and this distinctiveness appears to be even more pronounced in the four weeks preceding the repeat election. Based on the assumption that pro-government voters may be more inclined to watch this channel, it is plausible that they have been exposed to the incumbent’s call for remobilization and have shown their trust in their leader through this channel.

Last, TV’s collective dimension in Kenya may help explain the observed effect of media exposure. Limited ownership of TV sets leads people to rely on public places like cafes and restaurants to watch news broadcasts. This assumption suggests that TV viewing is a social experience, which could contribute to the consolidation of social coordination mechanisms. In line with this assumption, I find a positive a correlation between the availability of TV signal and the likelihood of individuals frequenting restaurants or cafes, after considering household characteristics and regional fixed-effects. These correlations provide descriptive evidence of the potential link between TV exposure in public places and collective behavior. </s>"

Finding_II:Male general upper-secondary education graduates do not earn higher wages than vocational education graduates.
Finding_III:Among employed male upper-secondary education graduates, general graduates are not more likely to have a public sector job, but they are more likely to have formal jobs in the private sector. </s><s>Assistant: The results suggest that male upper-secondary general education graduates aged 25–49 experience no advantage in terms of employment probability compared to vocational education graduates. Often, young men in developing countries cannot afford not to work (Fields, 2004), which also holds true in our sample, where approximately 90% of the observed men are employed independent of their highest education degree.7 However, a high level of employment alone is no guarantee of being able to make a living from it. Especially in countries with a large informal sector, such as Egypt, it is also important to account for the quality of employment.8 We do so using wages for those in wage employment. Wages are a central measure of employment quality contributing directly to workers’ material well-being (Cazes et al., 2015). In addition, we account for employment quality by using two measures for formal employment, namely, public sector and formal private sector employment, which are often associated with good working conditions and wages (Assaad, 1997, Krafft and Assaad, 2015, World Bank, 2014). We find that, conditional on wage employment, male general upper-secondary education graduates do not earn higher wages than vocational education graduates. This result likely reflects the low power of the first stage in the sample of male wage-earning upper-secondary graduates. Regarding job formality, we show that among employed male upper-secondary education graduates, general graduates are not more likely to have a public sector job. In contrast, conditional on private sector employment, male upper-secondary general education graduates are more likely to have formal jobs. Given this finding, it is surprising that our results do not suggest higher wages for general upper-secondary graduates, as formal private-sector jobs in developing countries are often associated with high productivity levels and high wages (Günther and Launov, 2012, La Porta and Shleifer, 2008). However, crony capitalism may limit the productivity of formal private-sector jobs in Egypt (Chekir and Diwan, 2014). Moreover, formal private sector jobs offer job security, and benefits such paid sick leave (World Bank, 2014).9 An analysis by age shows no statistically significant differences in the short or long term for any of the four outcomes, which is in contrast to the results of other studies in this area. (e.g. Hanushek et al., 2017, Brunello and Rocco, 2017). We confirm these findings through several robustness checks. Our findings on employment and wages are in line with some studies that demonstrate a neutral long-term effect, while our finding of a relative advantage of general education in terms of job quality contradicts the rest of the literature, where employment quality is often measured in terms of wages. The reasons for this difference could be the relatively low quality of vocational education in Egypt, low permeability of Egypt’s education system (Assaad, 2010, Krafft, 2018), or lack of work-based training. Involving the business sector could improve the labor market outcomes of vocational upper-secondary graduates (Bolli et al., 2021). </s>"

Finding_II:Farmer perceptions of soil similarity play an important role in individual contributions, with farmers contributing about 10% more when they perceive the sampled plot's soil type to be similar to their own.
Finding_III:Cooperative behavior within soil-type groups exists, but decreases as the group size increases, indicating the presence of free riding in larger soil-type groups. </s><s>Assistant: Our data and experimental results allow us to draw four conclusions.

First, we find that farmers contribute a considerable amount towards the soil test. Average individual contributions are 45% of the endowment, around 900 MK, implying an average total village contribution of 18,000 MK per round, significantly exceeding the 7000 MK cost of the soil test.

Second, farmer perceptions of soil similarity play an important role in these individual contributions. Exploiting within-farmer variation across rounds, we find that farmers contribute about 10% more when they perceive the sampled plot’s soil type to be similar to their own. This implies that farmers recognize that the management recommendations from the soil test are soil-type specific. For example, recommendations for a sandy soil will be of less use to a farmer with a loamy soil. We find comparable results when using alternative measures of similarity, such as distance between plots. The individual-level results suggest that social learning might be limited if soil heterogeneity increases.

Third, using an analysis at the soil-type level, we find that farmers exhibit cooperative behavior within their soil-type group, but that the degree of this cooperation depends on the size of the group. As the group size increases by five (the median group size), average individual contributions drop by 7% and the coefficient of variation of contributions within the group increases by 41%. In the context of this discrete (public) good, i.e. our soil test, this indicates that free riding plays a role in larger soil-type groups.5

Fourth, we find a positive correlation between village-level soil heterogeneity and average contributions. Villages with more soil types have higher individual contributions, on average. This result is relevant to extension workers, who might want to use local soil maps to proxy ex ante farmers’ willingness to invest in a village soil test. However, the correlation is no longer statistically significant when we add a wide range of village-level controls including market access and average demographic characteristics. This full suite of village attributes may not be available to extension workers; our results suggest that soil heterogeneity is correlated with these and possibly other unobservable characteristics in the village. </s>"

In line with expectations, we do not observe this effect in weeks when medical bills are covered by health insurance. Moreover, households sell a relatively larger share of milk in the spot market in weeks when households have less cash on hand, following periods of low levels of milk production and non-dairy income. These findings suggest that households sell in the market in order to satisfy urgent cash needs, while opting for less flexible (but higher-return) savings when in a more comfortable financial position. Interlinking cooperative membership with health insurance reduces the incentives to side-sell, but does not shield households from other liquidity constraints. Additional integration of the agricultural contract with financial services such as cash advances and credit may be necessary to further enhance the financial sustainability of cooperatives. </s>"

Finding_II:Tips make consumers more cautious, leading to a higher likelihood of classifying any given message as a scam.
Finding_III:Tips are effective in increasing scam identification ability only for more experienced DFS users and those with higher education. </s><s>Assistant: We find that on average tips do not increase scam identification ability. This null effect arises because while respondents in the treatment group are more likely to correctly identify scams, they are also less likely to correctly identify genuine messages. On average, tips appear to make consumers more cautious, i.e., more likely to classify any given message as scam. Moreover, receiving tips makes respondents significantly more confident in their classification decisions. The increase in confidence could be concerning as average SIA does not increase in our study and overconfidence has been found to be correlated with victimization (McAlvanah et al., 2015). However, we find suggestive evidence that higher confidence is associated with better SIA at the individual level.

Looking deeper, we find a more nuanced result depending on whether a given message contains a “scam marker”. First, tips increase the number of correctly identified scams, irrespective of whether a scam marker is present in the message. This suggests that tips indeed make people more cautious. Second, a scam marker in a genuine message increases the likelihood of this message being classified as a scam. Part of the null effect of tips thus seems to be driven by official messages that look like scams. This highlights that tips need to be specific enough to unambiguously increase SIA and that non-scam communication should avoid features that are commonly cautioned against in educational campaigns.

To test whether the results change when money is at stake, a random half of our sample receives incentives for each correct classification. Results show that incentives do not lead to better SIA, and there is no interaction effect with tips. While we find some indications that those who receive both tips and incentives exert more effort, these individuals are not performing better. This implies that our measure can be used as an unincentivized survey measure. We also investigate treatment effect heterogeneity and illustrate an important shortcoming of such education interventions. Tips appear to be effective in increasing SIA only for more experienced DFS users and those with higher education. Less educated participants do not benefit from tips, suggesting that it is difficult to design universally-helpful communication.

Finding_II:The increase in the stock of robots also resulted in a decrease in average wages in local labor markets by 0.77%.
Finding_III:The negative effects of robots on employment and wages were most pronounced in manufacturing industries and routine manual, blue-collar, assembly, and related occupations. </s><s>Assistant: Using this strategy, we estimate a negative relationship between a commuting zone’s exposure to robots and its post-1990 labor market outcomes. Our estimates imply that between 1990 and 2007 the increase in the stock of robots (approximately one additional robot per thousand workers from 1993 to 2007) reduced the average employment-to-population ratio in a commuting zone by 0.39 percentage points and average wages by 0.77% (relative to a commuting zone with no exposure to robots). These estimates are sizable but not implausible. For example, they imply that one more robot in a commuting zone reduces employment by about six workers; this estimate includes both direct and indirect effects, the latter caused by the decline in the demand for nontradables as a result of reduced employment and wages in the local economy. To understand the aggregate implications of these estimates, we need to make additional assumptions about how different commuting zones interact. Greater use of robots in a commuting zone generates benefits for the rest of the US economy by reducing the prices of tradable goods produced using robots and by creating shared capital income gains. Our model enables us to quantify these positive spillovers across commuting zones and leads to smaller but still negative aggregate effects. With our preferred specification, our estimates imply that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the aggregate employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percentage points and wages by about 0.42% (compared with its larger local effects, 0.39 percentage points and 0.77%, respectively), or equivalently, one new robot reduces employment by about 3.3 workers. We verify that our measure of exposure to robots is unrelated to past trends in employment and wages from 1970 to 1990, a period that preceded the onset of rapid advances in robotics technology. Several robustness checks further bolster our interpretation. First, our results are robust to including differential trends by various baseline characteristics, linear commuting zone trends, and controls for other changes affecting demand or productivity in various industries. Second, we show that the automotive industry, which is the most robot-intensive sector, is not driving our results. Third, consistent with our theoretical emphasis that robots (and more generally, automation technologies) have very different labor market effects than other types of machinery and overall capital deepening, we find no negative employment and wage effects from capital, other IT technologies, or overall productivity increases. The employment effects of robots are most pronounced in manufacturing and particularly in industries most exposed to robots. They are also concentrated in routine manual, blue-collar, assembly, and related occupations. Consistent with the presence of spillovers on nontradables, we estimate negative effects on construction and retail as well as personal services. </s>"

Given (ln) mean establishment earnings (MEE), industry, and occupation (in 2000), the gender earnings gap increases less: by 18.9 log points. Thus, 44 percent of the gap widening for college graduates is due to differential mobility between establishments by gender and 56 percent is due to differential earnings changes within establishments by gender (see also Barth, Kerr, and Olivetti 2017). For those who graduated high school but not college, the gap grows from ages 23 to 36 (1995–2008) by 15.6 log points but expands by just 8.1 log points given MEE (plus industry and occupation).

Finding_II:Increased availability of broadband internet is associated with a substantial increase in the output elasticity of skilled labor and a decrease in the output elasticity of unskilled labor.
Finding_III:Broadband adoption in firms is a skill-biased technological change, increasing the marginal productivity of skilled workers and lowering the marginal productivity of unskilled workers. </s><s>Assistant: We begin by estimating the intention-to-treat effects of the increased availability of broadband internet on the labor market outcomes and productivity of different types of workers. We find two pieces of evidence that suggest skill complementarity of broadband internet. On the worker side, we find that wages and employment of (un)skilled individuals increase (decrease) with broadband availability. On the firm side, we find that increased availability of broadband internet is associated with a substantial increase (decrease) in the output elasticity of (un)skilled labor. A comparison of the changes in output elasticities and worker outcomes suggest that firms earn substantial rent from increased availability of broadband internet, at least in the short run. After performing a battery of specification checks of the intention-to-treat effects, we explore several possible channels through which increased availability of broadband internet may affect worker outcomes and productivity. We find evidence against the hypothesis that our findings reflect changes in the demand for goods due to the expansion of broadband internet. Our data are also at odds with broadband adoption coinciding with general technical upgrading in firms. Another possible mechanism receiving little support in data is that our findings are driven by changes in labor productivity and wages in firms directly affected by the expansion of broadband access, such as telecom firms or IT consultancy companies. Instead, we find suggestive evidence that increased availability of broadband internet affects worker outcomes and productivity primarily through broadband adoption in firms. If that is the case, the plausibly exogenous variation in broadband availability may serve as an instrument for broadband adoption in firms. This allows us to estimate production functions where firms can change their technology by adopting broadband internet. We find that broadband adoption in firms is a skill-biased technological change, shifting how factor inputs are transformed into output. In particular, this technological change increases the marginal productivity of skilled workers, and lowers the marginal productivity of unskilled workers. To better understand the skill complementarity of broadband internet, we pursue a task-based approach to skill-biased technological change. Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) argue that ICT substitutes for workers in performing routine tasks—more amenable to automatization—and complements workers in executing problem solving, complex communication, and informationintensive tasks (often called ‘‘nonroutine abstract tasks’’).3 A necessary condition for a task-based explanation of the skill complementarity of broadband internet is that workers of different educational background actually cluster disproportionately in occupations that require different tasks. In our data, we find that skilled workers are overrepresented in occupations that are pervasive at nonroutine abstract tasks, whereas unskilled workers are often in occupations that involve routine tasks. Motivated by these differences, we estimate wage regressions which include interactions between broadband internet and the tasks performed in jobs in addition to the educational credentials of workers performing those jobs. The estimates suggest an important channel behind the skill bias of broadband internet is that it complements nonroutine abstract tasks but substitutes for routine tasks. </s>"

Women have definitely won from the transition from the communist economy to a market one, as their education is rewarded more highly by the labour market and they have much better education than men nowadays. Women have gained access to better jobs as the role of occupational segregation in explaining the gender wage gap has diminished. The only factor that has a similar effect in enlarging the gender wage gap in 1989 and 2020 is sectoral segregation, as there are still many more women employed in low wage sectors such as education and services. These trends have also been observed in other developed countries that do not have a communist past.

We show that despite the rapid and liberal economic reforms and the successful economic convergence, the gender wage gap has been resistant to decline. Estonia had the largest gender wage gap among communist countries in 1989 (Brainerd, 2000a, Brainerd, 2000b, Orazem and Vodopivec, 2000) and the largest gender wage gap in the EU in 2018 (Eutostat series TESEM180). None of the long-run cultural factors that have been found to shape gender attitudes can explain the wide gap. However, we demonstrate that country-level factors such as wage inequality, minimum wages and gender attitudes have helped narrow the gap. The strongest effect comes from wage inequality, and the decline in wage inequality can explain 6.5pp of the 15pp reduction in the unexplained gap. The gradual increase in minimum wages accounts for more than half of this effect. More egalitarian gender attitudes have also contributed to the closing of the gender wage gap, although this effect is probably responsible for a smaller part of the change compared to wage inequality. </s>"

Between 2014 and 2018, the gap at the 10th percentile was reduced by 4.6 percentage points (or 32%) in regions that were strongly affected by the minimum wage compared to less affected regions. For the gap at the 25th percentile, the effect still amounted to 18%, while for the mean it was smaller (11%) and not particularly robust. Using a continuous bite measure, we can show that an increase in a region’s bite by ten percentage points, reduces the wage at the 10th percentile by 3.3 percentage points. This thus shows that the minimum wage reform led to a significant decrease in the wage gap especially at the bottom of the wage distribution. </s>"

Finding_II:Women are less pre-disposed to negotiate and more risk-averse compared to men.
Finding_III:Gender differences in propensity to negotiate and risk preferences account for nearly one sixth of the unexplained component of the gender wage gap. </s><s>Assistant: Our results are as follows. First, analysis using the 2014 wave of the VHLSS data shows that the gender wage gap is negative, and statistically significant. There is substantial variation across and within sectors. We also find that the explained component of the gender wage gap is negative. This implies that women should earn more than men based purely on observable characteristics. The extent of the gender wage gap is the highest in the manufacturing sector. Second, using our experimental data, we show that women on average are () less pre-disposed to negotiate and () more risk-averse. Gender difference in the propensity to negotiate is, however, context-dependent. Men and women are equally likely to negotiate when wage offers are unfair. However, when wage offers are fair, men are 50% more likely to negotiate than women.5 Third, in our sample, we find women earn 6.4% less then men. Our subsequent decomposition analysis shows that the unexplained component of the gender wage gap is about 127% of the total gap. These results (which are consistent with those obtained using the nationally representative VHLSS data) imply that if workers were paid purely on the basis of their endowment, women would be earning more than men, i.e., the gender wage gap would be reversed. Fourth, including the propensity to negotiate in the set of explanatory variables is associated with a 13% reduction in the gender gap in earnings (the coefficient estimate of the female dummy increases from 0.067 to 0.060); similarly, including risk preferences is associated with a 14.5% decline of the earnings gap. Controlling for both is associated with a 29% reduction in the gender wage gap (the female dummy increases from 0.067 to 0.049). These results are consistent with the findings of our decomposition analysis, which shows that gender differences in propensity to negotiate and risk preferences together account for nearly one sixth (15.5%) of the unexplained component of the gender wage gap. Our results are in the same ballpark as previous studies in terms of comparability of the magnitude of effects. For example, gender differences in preferences towards entering competition account for about 20% of the difference in career choice between men and women (Buser et al., 2014), 7–10% of the gender wage gap among university students post-graduation (Reuben, Sapienza, Zingales, 2019, Kamas, Preston, 2018) and 18% of the gender gap in expectations about future earnings (Reuben et al., 2017). </s>"
"<s>Human: Write the 'research findings' with the information below:Finding_I:The arrival of mobile Internet in South Africa increased political participation.
Finding_II:Mobile Internet coverage led to a larger number of parties running for elections.
Finding_III:The popularity of the incumbent party decreased as a result of mobile Internet. </s><s>Assistant: I find that mobile Internet in fact increased people’s political participation in South Africa, and it did so immediately after its arrival.1 I also find a positive effect on political competition, reflected in a larger number of parties running for elections. In turn, after more than two decades, the undisputed dominance of the incumbent party was damaged. Altogether, these results suggest that mobile Internet has the potential to improve the quality of the democratic process in developing countries.
In the most conservative specification, my findings show that a unitary increase in 3G coverage (i.e. from 0 to 100% of area covered) led to a 2-percentage-point increment in voter turnout (approximately 4% of its value in 2006) in 2011 and 2016. At the same time, mobile Internet was detrimental for the popularity of the incumbent party, whose vote share dropped by more than 3 percentage points in 2016 as a consequence of mobile Internet. By contrast, other parties gained. Moreover, as a result of 3G, competition at ballots intensified: the number of parties running for elections in more covered localities went up by 10% compared to 2006. Lastly, the number of protests against political institutions roughly tripled in 2016, suggesting that mobile Internet arrival exacerbated political discontent or facilitated mass mobilization. The results are robust to different specifications, estimators and units of observations. Various placebo exercises support the validity of the identifying assumptions.
I complement these findings with suggestive evidence on the possible mechanisms. Following Campante et al. (2018) and Manacorda and Tesei (2020), I investigate the information and coordination potential of mobile Internet for local politics.3 For voters, access to mobile Internet can significantly decrease the cost of obtaining information and, eventually, affect their voting behavior. In line with this hypothesis, I find a more detrimental impact of 3G coverage on the performance of the incumbent party in municipalities with worse administration of government finances and in localities more exposed to socio-economic turmoil. At the same time, for (potential) candidates, digital technologies could drastically reduce communication and coordination costs with voters, thus making barriers to entry into politics easier to overcome, especially for smaller groups that lack significant financial resources. In this respect, I find that mobile Internet coverage facilitated political turnover and fostered political competition by favoring the emergence of new parties. Overall, these findings suggest that the arrival of 3G technology in developing countries can provide a new source of information for voters and a cheaper mass mobilization tool for candidates. </s>"

Finding_II:A steady stream of information from the platform resulted in priority treatment graduates catching up to the control group, with only a 4 percentage point difference in employment rates.
Finding_III:The impact of the digital platform varied across geographic zones in India, with the strongest reversal in employment rates observed among priority treatment graduates in the South West and East regions. </s><s>Assistant: We find a strong, but unexpected response to being enrolled on the platform: new graduates are 9 percentage points less likely to be working 12 months after being notified they would have access to Job Shikari. We also show that a steady stream of information for the priority treatment group results in these graduates “catching up” to the control group. Priority treatment graduates are only 4 percentage points less likely to be employed than control. This reversal in employment rates relative to the treatment group is statistically significant. These effects appear to be driven, at least in part, by changes in individuals’ beliefs about what the platform can do for them: we see that reservation wages increase for the treatment group, and fall for priority treatment.

We also find that some youth “catch up” more quickly than others. We look at differences across four geographic zones in India (North, Delhi, South West, and East). We find that the reversal in employment rates is strongest among priority treatment graduates located in the South West and East. This sample was older, from lower castes and more likely to be married relative to our sample in the North or Delhi — features that may have increased the opportunity cost of holding out for a job on Job Shikari. They were also spatially mismatched relative to jobs advertised by the platform, which were largely in Delhi. While these positive priority treatment effects we observe for youth in the South West could be generated by new matches, several patterns in the data suggest that this group learned the platform was delivering jobs they were unwilling to migrate for, which prompted them to accept outside offers more quickly rather than hold out for better opportunities on Job Shikari.

These results provide clear evidence of voluntary unemployment among the young adults in our sample, as predicted by seminal models of job search (McCall, 1970, Jovanovic, 1979): perceptions of access to new sources of job opportunities should boost reservation wages, and reduce employment in the short run. These effects may be larger and more persistent if youth have inaccurate expectations about the effectiveness of the platform, and if job opportunities fail to materialize. Nevertheless, as these recent graduates receive additional information about job opportunities they should update their perceptions of the new arrival rate of jobs and adjust their beliefs about their employment prospects. These predictions are borne out in our data: youth are overly optimistic about their wage prospects at baseline, and when they are notified that they will be registered with a digital platform they increase their reservation wages, and reduce employment for at least 1 year. However, when we increase the amount of information that job seekers in our sample receive about jobs, it appears that a subset may have been able to overcome their biased beliefs. This is consistent with work by Bandiera et al. (2023) who show that job seekers revise their beliefs downwards in response to negative signals about their labor market prospects (when call back rates from employers are lower than they anticipated).

These results also suggest that the impact of digital platforms depends crucially on individuals’ expectations of what these platforms can deliver. If platforms generate high expectations but the job offers are weak, we can expect to see some amount of voluntary unemployment as individuals hold out for better jobs. The magnitude, and stickiness, of this effect will depend on the extent to which individuals update their beliefs about the likelihood of finding a job. For several reasons, the digital platform we study may have been particularly well-suited to identifying this effect: job offers on the platform were relatively undesirable, and our sample of young, recent graduates may have been particularly susceptible to changing beliefs (and may have entered the study holding beliefs that were already biased by promotional statements from the training institutes they graduated from (Alfonsi et al., 2023, Banerjee and Chiplunkar, 2023). At the same time, we anticipate that this set of conditions may not be unusual. Youth are frequently the target of job matching interventions, particularly those that take place online. Moreover, private sector digital platforms may frequently have access to relatively undesirable opportunities: platforms commonly charge firms to make connections to job seekers, which is most valuable when matches are hard to find. For unskilled jobs, matches will be scarce when wages are low or working conditions are unappealing. If young graduates do not learn that platform jobs are negatively selected, they may stay unemployed for longer durations, as is the case in our study. This highlights the importance of educating youth about what they can expect from these new labor market interventions well ahead of time. </s>"

Finding_II:The intervention had an overall negative impact on caregivers' mental health, specifically increasing stress levels.
Finding_III:The intervention had different effects based on caregiver's sex, with negative impacts on mental health observed among male caregivers and reduced use of physical violence reported by female caregivers. </s><s>Assistant: We document the following main results. First, we show that over 70 percent of participants complied with the intervention by opening the SMS/WhatsApp messages, and this rate remained stable throughout the intervention. Using information assimilation surveys conducted during the intervention, we also document that caregivers in the treatment group were more likely than those in the control group to comprehend and implement the specific stress and parenting techniques taught in the program. Second, we find that the intervention had an overall negative impact on caregivers’ mental health. Contrary to what we had hypothesized in our pre-analysis plan, our estimations indicate that the mental health of treated caregivers worsened by 0.057 standard deviations (SD) relative to the caregivers in the control group. This effect was driven by a 0.072 SD increase in stress. Third, despite the negative impact on mental health, we find no evidence that the intervention changed caregiver impulsiveness, the quantity of caregiver–child interactions, caregiver perpetration of abuse and attitudes toward violent parenting, or children’s behaviors.
We also study the heterogeneity by caregiver’s sex. We find that the program’s overall unintended negative effects on mental health outcomes were concentrated among men: treated male caregivers’ stress and anxiety levels increased by 0.108 SD and 0.095 SD relative to the males in the control group. We observe no significant impact on women’s mental health.10 We also observe that, while the intervention led to 0.137 SD fewer interactions between male caregivers and children, it had no impact on this outcome among women. Finally, we find that the intervention reduced female caregivers’ reported use of physical violence by 0.098 SD but had no effect among men. Overall, our results show that the caregiver’s sex plays an empirically significant role in moderating the impact of this digital parenting intervention.
We conduct several robustness checks to validate our findings. We first address potential concerns about selective attrition between the treatment and control groups. For both the overall sample and when split by caregivers’ sex, our tests reveal no evidence of differential attrition. Addressing potential experimenter demand effects, we follow the methodology of Asadullah et al. (2021), evaluating changes in the caregivers’ social desirability index.11 We find no evidence that desirability bias changed among treated caregivers, regardless of their sex. Furthermore, including the social desirability index as an additional control does not affect the coefficients nor their standard errors, and, following Dhar et al. (2022), we find no heterogeneous effects based on the social desirability index. On a related issue, we discuss the existing literature to document the extent to which our results could have been driven by a change in the participants’ awareness of their mental health status. Subsequently, we assess the likelihood of spillovers within our experimental setting. While definitive conclusions about contamination across treatment arms are elusive due to lack of data to purposely test for it, our results from various tests indicate that it is unlikely that contamination occurred in our study. Finally, we verify the robustness of our results to the exclusion of control variables and to the use of randomization inference to estimate -values, following Young (2019). Our results remain similar in terms of magnitude and statistical significance.

We then explore the potential mechanisms that could explain the intervention’s negative and gendered effects. We provide evidence that indicates that the intervention had a greater negative impact on the mental health of male caregivers who live in more economically deprived households and who cohabitate with a partner. Additionally, we note that the negative impact on the frequency of caregiver–child interactions occurs primarily among male caregivers living with a partner. This finding indicates that parenting interventions may make men who cohabitate rely more on their partners to parent at a cost to their own (males’) mental health. </s>"

Finding_II:Individuals with DSL access are less likely to sleep between 7 and 9 hours, the recommended sleep duration.
Finding_III:Individuals with DSL access are less satisfied with their sleep. </s><s>Assistant: We first document the relationship between digital temptations and sleep using data drawn from the German Time Use Survey (German TUS) on sleep duration, time spent playing video games, using computer and smartphones, and watching television and videos/DVDs. Among teenagers (aged 13–19) and young adults (aged up to 30), there is a significant association between the likelihood of reporting insufficient sleep and time spent on computer games or watching TV and videos/DVDs in the evening. Among adults of older ages (aged 31–59), we also find evidence of a significant correlation between shorter sleep duration and the use of computers and smartphones. Interestingly, these associations survive to the inclusion of individual fixed-effects. This descriptive evidence motivates us to further investigate the causal nexus between digital temptations and sleep outcomes. Therefore, we examine the effects of access to high-speed Interneet (DSL) technology on sleep duration and sleep satisfaction using data drawn from the SOEP. Since Internet access increases the marginal utility of PC and tablets use, we hypothesize that it may lead to more technology use near bedtime, which in turn may affect sleep duration and sleep quality (Demirci, Akg?nül, Akpinar, 2015, Lemola, Perkinson-Gloor, Brand, Dewald-Kaufmann, Grob, 2015, Young, 1998). The main empirical challenge is that DSL access may be correlated with unobservable socio-demographic characteristics that simultaneously influence access to high-speed Internet and sleep duration. To tackle this potential endogeneity bias, we follow the IV approach proposed by Falck et al. (2014), who study the effects of Broadband on voting behavior. Their identification relies on the fact that the location of the main distribution frames (MDFs) across Germany was determined by historical circumstances unlikely to be correlated with the demand for high-speed Internet access. The idea underlying this strategy is that while the distance of a household from the MDF is a crucial cost factor for the adoption of DSL connection, the historical distribution of MDFs across Germany can be considered exogenous to current preferences for Internet access. Using confidential information on the residential geo-coordinates of the SOEP households, we calculate the distance of each household from the MDF. Furthermore, we also exploit the fact that several regions in East Germany adopted the optical access line (OPAL) technology in the early 1990s. While this telephone infrastructure was considered a state-of-the art technology at the time, it turned out to be incompatible with DSL technology. Thus, areas that adopted the OPAL technology in the 1990s faced higher barriers to broadband Internet deployment. In this paper, we rely on the variation in Broadband access induced by these historical peculiarities of the German communication network to identify the causal impacts of high-speed Internet on sleep duration and sleep satisfaction.

Our findings reveal a large, negative impact of high-speed Internet on sleep duration. Individuals with DSL access tend to sleep 25 min less than their counterparts without DSL Internet. They are significantly less likely to sleep between 7 and 9 h, the interval typically recommended by the scientific community (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). Furthermore, they are less likely to be satisfied with their sleep. These effects are mostly concentrated among younger adults. Consistent with what found by Giuntella et al. (2017) and Giuntella and Mazzonna (2017), the effects are larger among individuals facing time constraints in the morning due to work schedules or family duties. </s>"

Finding_III:The combination of 3G coverage and smartphone adoption is associated with a significant increase in the accident rate, suggesting that the advanced functions of smartphones while driving contribute to higher accident rates. </s><s>Assistant: Our initial results from fixed-effects Poisson regressions show that there is a statistically significant increase in the accident rate along a road segment once smartphone usage becomes available. At least two notable findings are observed in event study results. First, there is not a significant change in the accident rate prior to a road being treated with our measure of smartphone usage, reducing concerns that trends in the accident rate are biasing the estimated effect of smartphone use. Second, when we set the adoption of smartphones to occur earlier than 2009, the potential effect of 3G coverage on accident rates is delayed. When the adoption of smartphones is assumed to occur in 2010, there is an increase in the accident rate that precedes estimated smartphone use. The event study results suggest smartphone use by drivers began in 2009 and after that time, accident rates increase significantly when gaining 3G coverage.

Without further details about the cause of accidents, we are unable to determine the exact mechanism driving our results. However, a plausible story emerges from our analysis linking 3G coverage, the growth of smartphones and accident rates. When 3G coverage first became available in the mid-2000s, the functionality of cell phones did not immediately change, and accident rates and early 3G coverage are unrelated. Following the release of the 3G-compatible iPhone and Android smartphones in late-2008, there was an increase in mobile broadband subscriptions, text messaging and accessing of the internet while driving (Anderson, 2011). After restricting the first year of smartphone adoption to be 2009, we find a significant increase in the accident rate in areas where 3G is available. Our results suggest that 3G coverage alone does not appear to be responsible for traffic accidents, but the combination of 3G coverage and smartphone adoption is associated with an increase in the accident rate. </s>"

It temporarily reduced the rank correlation in player quality over time, helped younger players at the expense of older ones, reduced the average age of tennis players, and increased exit rates of older players relative to younger ones. We find that inter-generational inequality rose, though we find mixed evidence for the new racquets’ effects on cross-sectional inequality. We also consider competing explanations, but we conclude that they cannot explain many of the other patterns we find. Moreover, when we compare the ages of tennis players with other Olympic athletes, we do not find a similar drop in the ages of Olympic athletes during the same time period.

While tennis provides an ideal setting for documenting skill-altering technical change, the phenomenon extends far beyond tennis. Consider the case of farmers during the mid-twentieth century. It is difficult to overstate the effect of the rise of tractors on the nature of farming. While tractors made all farmers more productive, they also had subtler effects on optimal farming practices. With a tractor, the traditional approach to farming, which relied on work animals, gave way to new farming techniques that relied on machines. Thus, farmers who had spent a lifetime investing in animal husbandry skills saw the value of their skills eroded by the arrival of tractors. As another example, consider the development of computer-aided drafting in architecture during the 1980s, discussed in MacDonald and Weisbach (2004). This new software devalued drafting and engineering skills relative to artistic skills when designing new buildings. Older architects found the transition difficult, with the New York Times reporting that “as young architects plunge into the high-tech tide, older colleagues wade in gingerly.”1 In both examples, the new technology altered the relative value of different skills in an occupation. Consistent with skill-altering technical change, Fig. 1 shows that the average age in those occupations fell temporarily relative to the general population just after the new technology arrived. </s>"

Second, workers predict small causal wage penalties for a given worker switching between full- and part-time employment. Third, perceived raw and causal wage gaps are significantly correlated. Fourth, providing correlational information strongly affects beliefs about causal effects. Fifth, de-biasing effectively reduces selection neglect. Taken together, the results provide empirical evidence of causal misperceptions in the context of the part-time wage penalty. Although individuals do not na?vely equate average pay gaps with causal effects, they seem to account only insufficiently for worker selection. In addition, we show that beliefs about part-time pay gaps are predictive of labor supply choices, necessitating the prevention of causal misperceptions to avoid behavioral distortions. </s>"
"<s>Human: Write the 'research findings' with the information below:Finding_I:Earnings inequality in Germany increased significantly during the post-unification and Hartz reforms periods and remained high thereafter.
Finding_II:The main driver of rising earnings inequality in Germany is the increasing covariance between working hours and wages, particularly among male and female service sector employees.
Finding_III:The inability to realize optimal working hours, especially among female service sector employees, contributes significantly to rising earnings inequality. </s><s>Assistant: To preview our results, earnings inequality in terms of the MLD increases significantly from 0.19 to 0.29 during the post-unification and Hartz reforms periods and plateaus at a high level thereafter. The MLD decomposition reveals that only 10% of the increase in earnings inequality result from rising wage inequalities, but that rising working hours inequalities and especially the increasing covariance between working hours and wages play the predominant role. Since the 2000s, in contrast to earlier years, low wages are more often connected to low working hours. This changing pattern turns out to be the main driver of rising earnings inequality in Germany. With regard to the changing composition of the work force, rising wage inequality among male service sector employees is the most important contributor to increased inequality in hourly wages. Increasing inequality in hours can be fully attributed to rising working hours inequality among male and female service sector employees. These two subgroups are also responsible for the increased covariance between hours and wages.

Turning to the counterfactual earnings distribution, we also find an increase in earnings inequality, which mostly occurs in the post-unification and the Hartz reforms period. However, this increase is only about half the size of what is observed for the actual earnings distribution, with the MLD of counterfactual earnings increasing from 0.20 to 0.25. The MLD decomposition reveals that the attenuated increase in counterfactual earnings inequality is due to lower growth in the contributing factors of hours inequality and the covariance. The differences of inequalities in counterfactual and actual earnings are most pronounced—and rising—among female service sector employees. Here, inequality in counterfactual earnings and its three components remain constant over time. In other words, the inability to realize optimal working hours—particularly in the growing group of female service sector employees—contributes significantly to rising earnings inequality.

Our study also reveals changes in patterns of mismatch between desired and actual working hours. The share of overemployed people, those who work more hours than they would prefer, increases by seven percentage points among employees in the top quintile of hourly wages. At the same time, the share of underemployed people, those who prefer longer working hours, almost triples among employees in the bottom quintile. Additionally, we find increasing shares of underemployment among male and female employees in the service sector. These results also hold true after controlling for a broad set of control variables in multivariate regressions. Moreover, the regressions reveal that children are a major statistical explanation for underemployment among women, but not among men. This contradicts the notion that reduced working hours among mothers fully reflect their own choices and preferences. </s>"

Finding_III:The summertime mortality rate declined by up to 0.4 percent, corresponding to 1,975 fewer premature deaths per summer in the NBP states, mainly among individuals 75 and older. </s><s>Assistant: 5.
The empirical analysis produces several key results. First, there was a substantial decline in air pollution emissions and ambient concentrations. Figure 1 illustrates the dramatic effect of this market on NOx emissions in the states participating in the NBP.2 In 2001–2002, daily NOx emissions were fairly flat throughout the calendar year, with a peak in summer. In 2005–2007, NOx emissions were nearly 40?percent lower but almost entirely during the summer months when the NBP was in force. NOx emissions are a primary ingredient in the complex function that produces ozone air pollution, so it is unsurprising that we find that the large reductions in NOx led to declines in mean ozone concentrations of roughly 6 percent and reduced the number of summer days with high ozone levels (i.e., more than 65 ppb) by about 35 percent, or a third of a standard deviation.                                               6.
Second, these improvements in air quality produced substantial benefits.  Medication expenditures decreased by about 1.6 percent or roughly $800 million  annually in the 19 eastern and midwestern United States where the NBP was in  force; this is close to an upper bound estimate of the NBP’s total abatement costs.  This decline in medication expenditures is evident both among short-acting respiratory medications taken in response to the presentation of respiratory symptoms  and long-term control medications that are taken to prevent these episodes. Since  people can engage in other defensive investments like avoiding time outdoors or  purchasing air filters, medication expenditures provide a lower bound on the total  defensive costs associated with air pollution. Further, the summertime mortality rate  declined by up to 0.4 percent, corresponding to 1,975 fewer premature deaths per  summer in the NBP states, mainly among individuals 75 and older. The application  of age-adjusted estimates of the value of a statistical life (Murphy and Topel 2006) implies this reduced mortality is valued at about $1.3 billion annually. The mortality  estimates are less precise than the medication ones, and the results must be interpreted accordingly. Additionally, there is little systematic evidence of an effect of the NBP on hospitalization charges. Overall, it is striking that defensive investments  account for more than one-third of our estimate of total WTP for reductions in NOx emissions.    
7. 
Third, the paper provides the first instrumental variables estimates of the effect of NOx emissions on health and defensive investments. Such information is an essential determinant of air quality policy since NOx is a pollutant that can be controlled directly by regulation, whereas ozone cannot be. Ambient ozone is determined by a complex function based on several factors including NOx emissions, volatile organic compound emissions (VOCs), and temperature. These estimates suggest a significant causal link between NOx emissions, medication purchases, and mortality. For example, we find that a 10 percentage point (pp) reduction in NOx emissions leads to 0.06 to 0.011 pp reduction in medication purchases and also an 0.04 to 0.07 pp reduction in mortality. Further, it may be appropriate to conclude the reductions in ozone concentrations stemming from the reductions in NOx emissions are the primary channel for these health improvements; we cautiously report instrumental variable estimates that reveal positive relationships between ambient ozone concentrations and medication expenditures and mortality rates, respectively.                                                                                                                               </s>"

Finding_II:Emerging markets have larger magnitudes of idiosyncratic volatility compared to developed markets.
Finding_III:Financial risk factors, such as foreign exchange stability and foreign debt health, have the highest explanatory power over cross-sectional differences in country-level idiosyncratic risk. </s><s>Assistant: The results from our analyses show that the average country-level unconditional and conditional idiosyncratic volatility do not keep a stable trend. Specifically, the idiosyncratic volatility first increases and reaches a peak during the Asian financial crisis (1997– 1998). After 1998, idiosyncratic volatility demonstrates a downward trend before rising back again during the global financial crisis period of 2007–2008. In 2008, the idiosyncratic volatility reaches an all time high and then gradually decreases until 2016, the end of our sample period. In addition, as one can expect, we find the average country-level idiosyncratic volatility in emerging markets to be larger in magnitude compared to developed markets. Among determinants of country-level idiosyncratic volatility, we find that market turnover has a positive and significant relation with country-level idiosyncratic risk. Moreover, information disclosure and investor uncertainty avoidance degree are all seem to be negatively associated with the country-level idiosyncratic volatility. Lastly, improvements in economic, financial, and political risks, as measured by GDP growth, foreign exchange stability, foreign debt health, and non-corruption degree, decrease the country-level idiosyncratic risk significantly. Similarly, alternative economic and political risk factors, such as price stability, good social development level, good investment environment, and existence and observance of law and order help diminish country-level idiosyncratic volatility as well. Most importantly, among all sets of market structure, investor preference, and economic, financial, and political risk variables considered, we find financial risk factors, namely FX stability and foreign debt health, to have the highest explanatory power (highest adjusted R-squares in our regression specifications) over the cross-sectional differences in country-level idiosyncratic risk. Political risk factors and market structure variables also seem to explain the variation in idiosyncratic volatility across countries to a great extent. On the other hand, GDP growth, our measure for economic risk, and uncertainty avoidance, our measure for investor psychology, seem to have the least explanatory power over differences in country-level idiosyncratic volatility.1 In sum, with this paper, we find a significant connection between idiosyncratic volatility and country-level risk, and identify the best determinants of country-level idiosyncratic risk in international markets. We believe our results will help investors greatly with their risk management decisions in international markets as our findings will assist them identifying which risk factors to focus on to correctly estimate the country-level idiosyncratic risk. </s>"

Finding_II:The negative effect of conflict on a firm's output is non-linear, with the marginal effect becoming smaller for surviving firms as conflict intensity increases.
Finding_III:Conflict impacts more internationalized firms, leading to larger output drops and higher exit probabilities. </s><s>Assistant: Our empirical results are in line with these predictions. First, we show that an increase in the number of conflict events that occurred in the neighborhood of the firm’s location during the year has a highly significant negative effect on revenues. Using different non-linear specifications, we document that this effect is smaller when conflict intensity is higher, thereby indicating that the conflict-induced reduction in revenues is marginally decreasing. To validate our empirical results, we discuss various threats to the identification strategy, and we show that our results are robust to several checks. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that the relationship between conflict and a firm’s performance becomes convex for very high levels of conflict intensity. We then explore the possible mechanisms explaining the non-linear negative effect of conflict exposure on firms’ economic performance. In line with our conceptual framework, we show that conflict reduces the availability of production inputs, namely intermediates and labor, and it induces factors substitution. Specifically, intermediate inputs 1 This context is of intrinsic interest, as the conflict in Libya is one of the geopolitically most relevant of our times (World Bank, 2020). Libya is the major gateway to Europe, with up to 90% of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea departing from its borders (IOM, 2017; UN DESA, 2018; Di Maio et al., 2023). Moreover, Libya is among the main players in Africa’s oil industry, accounting for about 8% of the crude oil supply to the European Union (World Bank, 2020). For these reasons, Libya’s economic stability has important economic, social, and political consequences for neighboring countries, including Europe. decrease following a reduction in the number of suppliers and the firm’s import activity. At the same time, conflict reduces the number of employees, in particular the share of foreign workers. The conflict-induced reduction in inputs availability, by reducing the firm’s potential output, tends to reduce the firm’s economic performance. We label this the production inputs mechanism. We also show that this negative effect is larger for firms using foreign inputs more intensively and that the marginally decreasing effect of conflict is more pronounced for firms using a low share of foreign inputs. As an additional mechanism, we look at the effect of conflict on firms’ exit and market competition. We show that conflict increases the probability of exiting the market, in particular for firms using foreign inputs, and that, for high levels of conflict intensity, the conflict-induced reduction in the number of competitors mitigates the negative effect of conflict on revenues for surviving firms. We label this the market competition mechanism. The combination of these two mechanisms can thus account for the negative impact of conflict on firms’ economic performance and for the fact that its effect is marginally decreasing, more so for firms using less foreign inputs. Finally, to corroborate our findings, we rule out the existence of alternative mechanisms, such as the conflict-induced change in consumer demand, oil production, corruption, and illegal requests of payments to firms.

Finding_III:Spatial inequality is understated by DMSP data, especially in the urban sector, and misses intra-city heterogeneity in brightness for Jakarta. </s><s>Assistant: In the main part of the paper we report on the relationship between night lights and Indonesian GDP at the second sub-national level for 497 spatial units. The DMSP data do not appear to be a suitable proxy for GDP outside of cities, with a negative relationship between DMSP lights and the real GDP of non-urban spatial units, while VIIRS data positively relate to GDP. The negative lights-GDP relationship is especially for rural areas of low population density, in line with the conclusion of Chen and Nordhaus (2011) that luminosity data do not provide reliable estimates of economic activity for low output density regions. A related finding with cross-country data comes from Keola et al. (2015); DMSP night lights negatively relate to GDP if agriculture is a large share of GDP, while there is a positive relationship otherwise. In Indonesia’s urban sector, the lights-GDP relationship is positive irrespective of the type of night lights data used, but the relationship is twice as noisy if the DMSP data are used rather than the VIIRS data. We also find spatial inequality considerably understated by the DMSP data, especially in the urban sector. A Pareto-based adjustment from Bluhm and Krause (2018) to deal with top-coding in DMSP data has a modest effect but the adjusted data still greatly understate spatial inequality, and miss much of the intra-city heterogeneity in brightness (coming from key economic facilities) for Jakarta.

Similar patterns are evident for the other two countries we study. Spatial inequality is understated if the DMSP data are used as a proxy for local economic activity, especially in the urban sector or in higher density regions. Night lights data have higher predictive power for sub-national GDP when working with more aggregated spatial units, such as prov inces, while the gap between DMSP and VIIRS in terms of predictive power gets wider for analyses based on smaller or lower level units within the administrative hierarchy. The data for China allow us to compare lights-GDP relationships in the primary sector with those in industrial and services sectors and this comparison shows that night lights data are a poor proxy for primary sector economic activity. Overall, our results suggest that great caution is needed if development economists use night lights data, not only for low density rural areas but also when studying the spatial patterns of urban development. </s>"

Furthermore, EMI1 offers an expost Sharpe ratio, 0.23, which is higher than that of all the above factors except the mispricing factor (0.27). The EMI2 factor has similar but slightly lower average monthly return (0.26%) and ex post Sharpe ratio (0.15). The high level of the equity premium is a well-known puzzle for rational asset pricing theory (Mehra and Prescott, 1985). Therefore, on the face of it, the high ex post Sharpe ratios associated with the EMI factors also suggest that the IE-return relation can be too strong to be entirely explained by rational risk premia.

Adding EMI1 to the Fama and French three factors increases the ex post Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio from 0.29 to 0.39 with a weight of 42% on EMI1. Even when all of the above factors are included, the weight on EMI1 in the tangency portfolio is 22%, which is substantially higher than that of any of the other factors. Adding EMI2 to the Fama and French three factors increases the ex post Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio from 0.29 to 0.34 with a weight of 33% on EMI2.

Our baseline estimates suggest that an increase in air pollution is positively associated with a higher likelihood and numbers of social conflicts. Furthermore, our instrumental variable approaches yield consistent but substantially larger results compared to the estimates in the baseline fixed effect model, suggesting significant bias if endogeneity is not accounted for. In terms of nonlinearity, the impacts of air pollution on social conflicts display a monotonically increasing pattern, highlighting the need for particular attention to severe air pollution. Our baseline findings are robust to numerous checks, including data manipulation, alternative fixed effects and model specification, alternative instrument using wind patterns, and placebo tests. In addition, we observe a significant difference in the impact of air pollution on social conflicts for indoor vs. outdoor workers, with cumulative effects at the monthly level, while the estimated coefficient is higher in developed regions than in developing regions at the daily frequency level, which may be related to their differences in the awareness of rights defense. Lastly, we use lottery sales as a measure of risk preference and find that rising air pollution increases lottery sales, suggesting that the causal effects of air pollution on social conflicts may be triggered by an increased propensity to engage in risky actions. </s>"

This is particularly crucial for assessments of rainfall, for which spatial variability is considerably larger than for temperature4 . We explicitly evaluate the spatial autocorrelation of these rainfall measures (Supplementary Fig. 1) at the subnational level of our economic data, the results of which suggest that the level of spatial detail used here is appropriate to address the problem of spatial aggregation (Supplementary Section 1). We then apply fixed-effects panel regression models to estimate the effect of these aspects of the distribution of daily rainfall on economic production. This approach uses within-region changes in climate variables from one year to the next to assess their impact on economic outcomes. As such, it allows us to account for unobserved differences between regions, contemporaneous global shocks and regional time trends (Methods), strengthening the identification of causal effects between changes in rainfall and economic production. </s>"

A firm’s one standard deviation increase in CSR will lead to a 0.655% decrease in IR. Subsequently, we include CSR-squared in our model and find that its coefficient is positive and significant, indicating that the relationship between CSR and IR is U-shaped. To explore the proposed underlying mechanism of this relationship, we analyze the effects of the two moderating variables (OE and AII) on the relationship obtained with the basic model. As we supposed, OE moderates the relationship by shifting the turning point to the right. This means that OE weakens the negative effect of CSR and thus high-OE firms can obtain a lower IR by improving CSR. Mean[1]while, AII moderates the U-shaped relationship by flattening the curve. This indicates that AII inhibits CSR’s positive effect, which conforms to the substitution effect of AII on CSR. These findings verify our analysis of the U-shaped relationship in which CSR has both negative and positive influences on IR.

Finding_III:The positive effects of the reform were not solely driven by a transfer of economic activities, but rather by genuine increases in aggregate economic development. </s><s>Assistant: Our results indicate that the reform significantly increased economic growth in the incorporated counties between 1995 and 2013. Compared to the applied-but-failed counties, the reform raised incorporated counties’ GDP per capita by 11.7 percent and nighttime light intensity per square kilometer by 4.8 percent in ten years. Using the second approach, we find that the reform led to a 10.3 percent increase in GDP per capita and a 3.9 percent increase in nighttime light intensity per square kilometer for counties that experienced current incorporation, compared to counties that would experience the reform several years later. The effect of the reform is both immediate and persistent. In the first year following the reform, the treated counties’ economic growth surpassed that of the control counties, which is possible if there were “immediate” reallocations of resources due to the lifting of inter-regional barriers. We also find that the treated counties still grew faster than the control counties ten years after the reform, suggesting that the effects of the reform were persistent.

To address concerns that the positive effects of the reform on treated counties were due to involuntary migration of economic activity from prefecture-level cities without any gain in overall economic development, we examine the economic growth of both the treated counties and the prefecture-level cities they were incorporated into. If the positive effects of the reform were solely due to a transfer of economic activities, we would expect the overall impact on the treated counties plus their prefecture-level cities to be zero. However, our analysis reveals that the reform increased the total GDP per capita of the treated counties and their prefecture-level cities by 6.6 percent. This finding suggests that the positive effects of the reform were not solely driven by a transfer of economic activities, but rather by genuine increases in aggregate economic development.

After establishing the positive impact of the reform that incorporated counties into prefectures, we explore its underlying mechanisms. We first explore whether the reduction in market barriers can potentially explain the positive effect of the reform. Constrained by available data, we examine the empirical evidence for reductions in frictions in the product market, the labor market, and firm entry and exit. To achieve this, we utilize the Annual Industrial Surveys, a comprehensive firm panel dataset conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics.3

In the product market, our investigation initially focuses on whether inter-regional trade barriers have been reduced since counties were incorporated. To measure the degree of such trade barriers, we follow (Bai et al., 2004) and examine the negative correlation between an industry’s share of SOEs and its level of geographical concentration. This is because local governments tend to prioritize protection for SOEs over other types of enterprises, leading to less competition and geographic specialization in industries with high shares of SOEs. We expand upon (Bai et al., 2004)’s provincial-level findings by examining this negative correlation at the county level, where we find that it still holds true. Importantly, our analysis reveals a significant reduction in this negative correlation within treated counties compared to control counties following the reform.

Next, we explore whether treated counties reallocated towards their most productive sectors following the reform. According to Melitz (2003), international trades induce reallocations towards more productive firms where they enter export markets and absorb shares from less productive ones. Our hypothesis is that since the reform eliminated product market barriers, treated counties should specialize more in industries where they have comparative advantages. Our findings show that production shares for the most productive sector increased by 2 percentage points on average after the reform within treated counties — representing a 25 percent increase from their original levels.4

In the labor market, we investigate whether there were any population increases in treated counties following the removal of labor market barriers through reform. However, our findings did not reveal any significant changes in the size of the registered population within these treated counties.5 It is possible that there were no substantial migration barriers between counties and prefectures even before the reform. Alternatively, it could also be plausible that people – especially those who were already registered in prefectures prior to incorporation – migrated to these treated counties without changing their residence. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, we cannot verify this hypothesis.

Lastly, we demonstrate that the reform reduces barriers to entry and exit for firms. We observe an immediate and consistent increase in firm entries in treated counties compared to control counties after the implementation of the reform. This immediacy suggests that infrastructure enhancements are not responsible for these entries since they require time to establish. Regarding barriers to exit, our findings indicate that less profitable firms in treated counties were significantly more likely to leave after the reform was implemented. This aligns with the mechanism that reducing entry and exit barriers increases competition among firms, which compels less profitable ones to withdraw (Melitz, 2003).

An alternative explanation for the positive effect is that this reform alters government structure and behavior, leading to increased growth in incorporated counties. We explore several potential changes in government behavior resulting from this reform. Firstly, an increase in inter-governmental fiscal transfers from the prefecture-level government may allow governments of incorporated counties to spend more. Secondly, it could be because more state-owned enterprises are being subordinated by the prefecture to incorporated counties which contribute to economic growth there. Thirdly, treated counties may become more likely targets for subsequent growth-oriented reforms which drive output increases; one such example is the “economic zones” reform, which has been shown by Lu et al. (2019) to significantly promote growth in counties with these zones.6 However, after examining each of these changes individually, we found no significant difference between incorporated and control counties — suggesting that none of these factors can fully explain our results. </s>"

Finding_III:Chinese demand mitigated the deforestation impacts arising from GE soy seeds, as areas highly exposed to both shocks underwent a transition from cultivating other crops to soybeans, reducing the relative impact of GE soy on deforestation. </s><s>Assistant: Our findings unveil the distinct impacts of these two shocks and underscore the necessity of considering them together. When examining the effects of trade and productivity in isolation, we find that municipalities more exposed to the rising export demand from China experienced a more rapid decline in forest cover compared to less exposed areas. Similarly, municipalities with greater exposure to productivity gains from GE soy seeds experienced increased deforestation compared to areas that did benefit from the new technology. However, when these two are considered together, we find that only the GE soy seed shock remains statistically significant and economically meaningful. This implies that one would arrive at different conclusions regarding the impact of local exposure to export demand when analyzing it in isolation from the largest agricultural technological shock during that period.

We then investigate the combined effects of being exposed to both GE soy seeds and Chinese demand by adding an interaction between the two shocks to our econometric model. We find that while Chinese demand did not seem to exert a substantial direct differential impact on deforestation, it mitigated the deforestation impacts arising from GE soy seeds. This is because municipalities highly exposed to both shocks underwent a transition from cultivating other crops to soybeans, relieving pressure on the primary ecosystem and thereby reducing the relative impact of GE soy on deforestation.

We also break down the impacts on the extensive margin of crop production. We find that exposure to GE seeds increases the likelihood that a municipality engages in soy production, with this effect being more pronounced in municipalities exposed to both shocks. Interestingly, Chinese demand appears to have decreased the probability of soy cultivation in a given municipality. These findings suggest that GE seeds pushed soy production to areas that were previously economically unviable, with the effect being stronger in areas concurrently exposed to Chinese demand shocks. However, the soy extensive margin impact of the combined shocks was not enough to drive deforestation up, because of the reduction in the area allocated to other crops and in the probability of these other crops being planted. </s>"

Finding_III:The presence of market imperfections and restrictions on cash transfers led to higher prices in the new market for digital cash transfers or vouchers. </s><s>Assistant: We find that the applicants selected to get a license massively benefit from the cash transfer program. Licensed applicants have monthly business revenues that are 3784 USD higher on average than unlicensed applicants (＋175%).6 The effect of licenses on profits is also positive and large. Applicants who received a license have monthly business profits that are 685 USD higher on average than unlicensed applicants (＋154%). Licensed applicants also have more employees and higher labor productivity, they sell a larger variety of commodities, and their households have higher living standards than the control group.

These massive effects are partly explained by the fact that successful applicants are more likely to have a business (＋24 percentage points), but also that licensed businesses are much more successful than unlicensed businesses. We estimate that the effect of getting a license on profits is higher than 526 USD per month (＋86%) for businesses that would exist even in the absence of cash transfer program. This estimate, which is a lower-bound, is extremely large, about 18 times the average monthly wage of paid employees (about 29 USD) and 39 times the value of monthly food assistance per refugee (about 13 USD). Importantly, we find no significant effect on sales for hard cash, suggesting that negative spillovers between licensed and unlicensed businesses are limited.

The large profits observed in the food retail sector provide evidence of market imperfections in Kakuma and Kalobeyei. These market imperfections have been magnified by the digital cash transfer program. Using data from a household survey, we find that households are charged higher prices for purchases paid with digital cash transfers compared to purchases with hard cash. The digital cash transfer program has generated two parallel markets. On the one hand, the market for hard cash transactions is relatively competitive, with about 1400 shops offering low prices to attract consumers. On the other hand, the new market for digital cash transfers is restricted to 252 licensed vendors which can charge higher prices. Because of market imperfections, licensed businesses capture part of the benefits of the cash transfer program. Our analysis suggests that most refugees would gain from policies addressing these market imperfections.

More generally, our findings caution against the establishment of a less competitive, parallel market for distributing cash-based assistance. Organizations implementing cash-based interventions should identify and address market imperfections to limit rent-seeking by businesses and maximize positive impacts on cash transfer recipients. How to do that effectively is a topic for future research. </s>"

Finding_II:EZs with female-dominated industries have a significant impact on improving women's intra-household bargaining power.
Finding_III:The establishment of EZs in China increases the probability of women being employed in the non-agricultural sector, leading to increased female income. </s><s>Assistant: The analyzes proceed in four stages. First, using the establishment of EZs during the sample period as a natural experiment, we examine the impact of EZs on self-reported intra-household decision-making by using a reduced-form approach. We find that exposure to EZs significantly increases the probability of a mother making a decision. However, given that self-reported proxies for bargaining power suffer from subjective biases, we recognize that a more precise measure of the allocation of resources within the household is needed to overcome this limitation.

Second, we apply a structural model of intra-household allocation to estimate resource shares, that is, the fraction of total household spending allocated to each family member (Browning et al., 2013). Since the allocation of household resources is unobserved in practice and hard to identify, we employ a collective household model (see Chiappori, 1988, Chiappori, 1992, Browning and Chiappori, 1998) to estimate resource shares. In this framework, each family member has a separate utility function over goods, and the household is Pareto efficient in its allocation of goods. Resource shares are identified by comparing Engel curves of food items consumed exclusively by a particular person type, such as men, women, and children (Dunbar et al., 2013). From our dataset, we find that the EZ program has a significant and positive impact on women’s bargaining power and their ability to access household resources. Specifically, we estimate that exposure to EZs increases women’s resource shares by 1.68 percentage points for all households and 1.87 percentage points for households with children. These findings are determined to be robust by using the matched sample that addresses the potential endogeneity of EZs’ establishment. These structural estimates are consistent with the reduced-form evidence. Both support the importance of the EZ program in shaping women’s position within the household.

Third, to further understand the factors underlying the improvement in women’s bargaining power, we examine the relationship between prominent industries of EZs and women’s resource shares using the information from China Development Zone Audit Announcement. Results show that the improvement of women’s intra-household bargaining power is almost entirely driven by EZs with female-dominated industries, indicating that the creation of labor market opportunities for women is the main driving force behind the increase of women’s resource shares. Then, we examine the impact of the EZ program on rural employment using individual-level data. Our results show that the establishment of EZs significantly increases the probability of women being employed in the non-agricultural sector and the sectoral reallocation increases female income. These results shed new light on the mechanisms and magnitudes of these popular policy tools.

Fourth, we analyze the impact of place-based policies on children’s outcomes of interest. EZs may influence women’s bargaining power and employment status, which, in turn, has impacts on the way they support and raise their children.

Finding_II:The ability to identify the enemy affects the certainty of whom people can trust.
Finding_III:Low exposure to violence fosters social capital, but as violence becomes more severe, social capital is negatively affected. </s><s>Assistant: Broadly, this paper presents three sets of results. First, at the mean, violence has a negative and statistically significant effect on different measures of social capital. The estimated effect is quantitatively large and robust to alternative explanations of spillover effects and economic activity. A one standard deviation increase in the rate of violence is associated with a 38%, 22%, and 23% standard deviation decrease in trust, participation in community organizations, and contribution to solving problems, respectively. The magnitude of the effect is relatively large; taking trust as an example, this corresponds to the difference in trust levels between Germany and Colombia.6 Second, these results seem to be driven by the fact that (as observed in other non-related conflicts) no basic cues were available to identify friend from foe, making people especially wary about whom they could trust. To this regard, I present evidence that individuals were afraid to interact with their communities. Indeed, they report a fear of running in local elections as well as of participating in community organizations as a result of non-identifiable perpetrators.

Finally, I document that the intensity of the exposure to violence matters as well. Low exposure to violence fosters social capital, possibly because local cooperation serves as a strategy to confront external threats. However, as violence becomes increasingly severe, social capital is negatively affected, consistent with the theoretical framework presented by Jennings and Sanchez-Pages (2017). My estimates imply that individuals living in a Colombian municipality with the same level of violence as in the U.S., become more involved with their communities when experiencing violence, arguably a way of reacting in difficult times. This contrasts with an observed decrease in social capital in municipalities that have experienced levels of violence similar to Brazil or Mexico. Additionally, I show that when communities are able to identify the perpetrators, the decrease in social capital is less strong as compared to when it is not possible to identify the perpetrators. Thus, the results of this study provide crucial insights for understanding the effects of conflict in other developing countries. </s>"

Finding_III:The total number of children per woman drops by 24% for women close to UN bases. </s><s>Assistant: Our findings suggest that peacebuilding has a significant, negative effect on fertility. We find that the likelihood of having a child decline by 5 percentage points and the total number of children per woman drops by 24% for women close to UN bases. This effect is particularly pronounced among older and married women, and those with more children at the time of the UN deployment. In exploring the mechanisms underpinning these findings, we find evidence of increased contraceptive use, increased access to healthcare and better health outcomes for women and children, which suggest a shift towards a “quality over quantity” approach to parenting. In addition, we observe a shift in parents' employment away from farming toward more clerical jobs as well as sales and service sectors, which have higher labour productivity and higher salaries, resulting in a higher childbearing opportunity cost. </s>"

We also find that households who currently have mortgage debt are less likely to invest in WMPs than other households, regardless of the amount of their current unpaid mortgage balance. Consequently, facing a lower funding supply from the household sector, financial institutions have to offer more promising returns to raise money. </s>"

Finding_II:Impacted households successfully smooth their consumption and experience almost no contemporaneous effect on total living expenses and itemized expenditures on food, fuel, service, and inter-household transfers.
Finding_III:Impacted households adjust their crop mix toward a portfolio with a larger share of heat-resistant but lower-value crops in the three years after the heat shock. </s><s>Assistant: We find that extreme heat significantly reduces corn yields and leads to substantial economic losses of corn-growing households in northeast China. A one-standard-deviation increase in harmful degree days (HDD) – a measure of extreme heat – decreases corn yields by more than 11% (significant at the 0.001 level) and leads to a roughly 6% reduction in total farm revenue (significant at the 0.05 level). Although the economic loss is substantial, the impacted households have successfully smoothed their consumption. Our results show that increasing HDD has almost no contemporaneous effect on the household’s total living expenses and itemized expenditures on food, fuel, service, and inter-household transfers. The consumption impact is also very limited in the post-shock years, given that we only observe a modest curtailment in the non-essential demand in years after the households experience heat shocks.

We illustrate that the households smooth their consumption mainly through using liquid financial assets and available buffer stocks. Leveraging detailed information on various assets, we find that both cash in hand and corn stocks are significantly drawn down when the households experience an increase in HDD, especially among the households who regularly maintain these buffers. We interpret these smoothing behaviors as evidence that the households have engaged in precautionary saving as a coping strategy for unanticipated income shocks. Consistent with this motive, we find that the impacted households promptly re-build their depleted financial assets and stocks in years after experiencing extreme heat. In our context, utilizing cash and stocks for compensating heat-induced revenue losses is proven to be very effective. With a decomposition analysis, we show that the cash savings would mitigate roughly half of the revenue loss and the stocks would compensate for another one third.

With the capability of smoothing consumption effectively, the corn households in our context may have a low incentive for engaging in costly contemporaneous production adjustments. Indeed, unlike within-season input adjustments documented in other developing country contexts, we find no significant response among rural households in northeast China in any of the variable inputs including fertilizer, pesticides, power, labor, and irrigation use, and there has also been no contemporaneous adjustment in land use. However, forward-looking households may adjust production in response to past shocks, anticipating potential losses induced by extreme heat in the future. In particular, we find that, over the three years after the shock, the impacted households adjust their crop mix toward a portfolio with a larger share of heat-resistant but lower-value crops, consistent with the precautionary-saving motive reflected in their asset management. </s>"

Finding_II:The integration does not significantly affect overall university enrollment, but it changes the composition of enrollment by institution type.
Finding_III:The integration has positive equity effects, as low-income students are more likely to enroll in university due to reduced application costs. </s><s>Assistant:  We begin by showing that, as expected, the platform integration increased the number of platform users by 13 percentage points (pp.) and decreased the proportion of students rejecting a G25 offer. This last result implies a more efficient market that suffers less from waitlist congestion. However, we find that the platform integration did not affect student's university enrollment in the subsequent years but changed their enrollment composition by institution type in a dynamic way. The year of the market integration, student's G8 and G25 enrollment remain unchanged; but one year after the integration, student's G8 enrollment increases by 3pp. (statistically significant at 5% level) and G25 enrollment decreases 1.6pp. (non-statistically significant). These effects are also followed by an increase in student's sorting into programs. We provide suggestive evidence that the mentioned effects are driven by the release of previous year admission cutoffs for programs joining the platform, which happens the year after the integration (the integration year there is not previous year platform cutoffs).7 The historical admission cutoff seems to inform student's about their probability of being admitted into a program and therefore, induce more informed student's decisions. Finally, we show that low-income students are 3.6pp. more likely to enroll in university after the integration. This seems to happen because of lower student's application costs to new platform university after the platform integration. All results together suggests that application and cutoff information costs could affect student's decision making and that the platform integration has both equity and efficiency effects.

We show that our results are robust to alternative explanations. First, we show that results are not driven by the platform integration increasing the fraction of students taking the test or meeting the platform usage requirements. Second, we also evaluate whether the integration increased the fraction of students in the control group interested and enrolled in G8 commuting zone universities. Using data on ex-ante preferences of study location, we show that control group students do not seem to prefer more G8 commuting zone universities after the integration. Third, results do not change if students’ location restriction is set at the regional rather than at the commuting zone level. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that universities did not react by increasing the number of seats, degrees offered or increasing their enrollment yield. </s>"
"<s>Human: Write the 'research findings' with the information below:Finding_I:Electricity outages reduce the probability of employment by about 13.5 percentage points in Africa.
Finding_II:The 'dumsor' power crisis in Ghana increased unemployment by 4.7 percentage points.
Finding_III:Outages are associated with a 4.7 to 13.5 percentage point increase in unemployment in the region. </s><s>Assistant: The main finding of the paper is that electricity outages exert a non-trivial negative impact on employment. From the cross-country analysis, I find that outages reduce the probability of employment by about 13.5 percentage points (pp). The results of the country case studies in Ghana and Nigeria also show a negative effect of outages on employment that are economically and statistically significant, albeit with relatively low magnitudes. The estimates suggest that the “dumsor” power crisis in Ghana increased unemployment by 4.7 pp. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, outages are associated with a 5.7 pp increase in unemployment. Thus, overall, the estimates suggest that outages are associated with a 4.7 pp to 13.5 pp increase in unemployment in the region. Additionally, evidence from the paper suggests that the effects are largely concentrated in employment in non-agricultural sectors and skilled jobs. Employment of unskilled workers is unaffected by outages. Also, the job losses associated with outages are largely borne by private-sector workers, highlighting the response of private firms to unfavorable business conditions.

Further, the paper shows evidence of a reduction in firm entry and performance of incumbent firms as plausible channels through which electricity outages affect employment. In relation to firm entry, evidence from the Ethiopian firm census data shows manufacturing firms have a lower tendency of operating in places with a high prevalence of outages. The effects are even more pronounced among firms in high energy-intensive sectors, highlighting the importance of reliable supply of energy to firms in such sectors. Even among incumbent firms, those operating in areas with an unreliable supply of power operate for shorter duration(s) relative to firms in places with reliable supply, due to the negative effects of outages on capacity utilization. The evidence from Ghana also lends support to the findings on the negative impact of outages on firm entry. Our findings suggest that the “dumsor” power crisis (2012–2016) in Ghana led to a 12.3% decline in FDI.7 Rising cost of doing business and unfavorable macroeconomic shocks induced by the crisis are plausible explanations behind the slump in FDI. As a result, new businesses that would have otherwise created jobs were lost.

Secondly, in relation to the negative effect of outages on the performance of incumbent firms, I find that, for instance, a percent increase in the frequency of outages experienced by firms reduces sales, sales per worker, and value-added per worker by 1.2%, 1.3%, and 2.3% respectively. Labor demand also falls in response to exposure to outages, with the employment of temporary workers the most affected: a percent increase in outage frequency (duration) is associated with a 0.58% (0.32%) reduction in the number of temporary workers hired by firms. The effect on demand for full-time workers is also negative albeit statistically insignificant. In addition, the results show a negative and significant effect of outages on total labor cost and labor cost per worker. This provides suggestive evidence that firms, perhaps, respond to the declining revenue induced by outages by reducing wages. </s>"

Finding_II:A reduction in urban cohort sizes in destination prefectures pulls rural migrants into the destination prefecture.
Finding_III:An increase in urban population size attracts rural migrants from less developed origin prefectures. </s><s>Assistant: We incorporate both the demographic impact of migration and economies of agglomeration into a single theoretical framework with economic explanations of understanding the mechanism behind the push, pull, and agglomeration factors (Roback, 1982, Borjas, 1987). From the theoretical model, we bring in the empirical tests of a gravity model consistent with the theoretical predictions. We find that an increase in rural cohort size by 1,000 people pushes 125 rural migrants out of the origin prefecture, while a reduction in urban cohort sizes in destination prefectures by 1,000 people pulls 769 rural migrants into the destination prefecture. Besides the demography of migration, the economies of agglomeration work in the opposite direction: An increase in urban population size by 1,000 people attracts 352 rural migrants from the less developed origin prefecture. Our results are also robust to various concerns, including differential trends by the initial development levels, institutional reforms on the household registration system, trade-induced demand shocks, and the measurement of migration flows. Compared with cross-country studies, the study of internal migration within a country limits the size of unobserved heterogeneity, e.g., differences in labor market institutions. Our findings on the asymmetric impact of pull and push factors, i.e., the effects of push factors are smaller than that of pull factors, are also emphasized in the international migration literature (Mayda, 2010). </s>"

Finding_III:The estimated long-run climate effects on cropland areas are highly robust. </s><s>Assistant: We find that climate change has spatially differentiated impacts on total cropland areas, depending on the initial climate endowments in a region. A long-run increase in temperature normals expands cropland in cold regions but reduces cropland in hot regions; while a long-run increase in precipitation normals increases cropland in dry regions but decreases cropland in humid regions. Using the “long-difference” approach delivers estimates highly consistent with those obtained from our preferred specification. We carry out a battery of checks on potential issues arising from the confounding variations in weather and climate, agricultural and land-use policies, crop prices, socioeconomic factors of the local rural economy, irrigation status, and issues related to sample selection and measurement errors in the data. These checks illustrate that our estimated long-run climate effects are highly robust.

In line with our prediction for bid-revision behavior in the presence of quality misperceptions, we find that actual bids increase in response to positive quality signals and decrease with negative quality signals.

Finding_II:For respondents living in areas where FGC was practiced in pre-colonial times, the reduction in likelihood is 6 percentage points.
Finding_III:The number of historical missions in respondents' ancestral ethnic homelands is negatively associated with the likelihood of FGC, with one more mission per 1000 km2 decreasing the likelihood by 8 percentage points. </s><s>Assistant: The empirical results indicate that historical Christian missions did indeed have a long-run impact on FGC practices that persists to this day. The benchmark estimates suggest that a person living 10 km from a historical mission is approximately 4 percentage points less likely to have undergone FGC than someone living 100 km from a mission site. For respondents living in areas where FGC was practiced in pre-colonial times, the equivalent difference is 6 percentage points. The estimated effects are robust to a number of specifications and control variables.

To investigate potential mechanisms, we match our data on FGC and missions with granular geo-spatial data on night lights and on the size of urban agglomerations and use within-survey data on education, religious affiliation and urban residence. Controlling for these possible mechanisms has little impact on estimates. While we cannot provide direct evidence, this is consistent with an impact of missions on norms, which has then persisted. We also investigate the impact of number of missions in respondents' ancestral ethnic homelands. One more historical mission per 1000 km2 in the respondents’ ethnic homeland decreases the likelihood of FGC by on average 8 percentage points. The impact of missions in the ancestral ethnic homeland remains significant when we include missions in the geographic ethnic homeland where they currently live, arguably highlighting the role of intergenerational norm transmission within ethnic groups. </s>"

Finding_II:Women are more likely to underreport income among both migrants and their spouses staying behind.
Finding_III:Underreporting of income is greater when information is more difficult to observe and less likely to be verified. </s><s>Assistant: I document four findings. First, both migrants and their spouses have biased beliefs about each other’s finances. Migrants underestimate their spouses’ income and overestimate their spouses’ expenses, whereas spouses staying behind underestimate migrants’ less-observable non-wage benefits. Second, spouses staying behind underreport their monthly income by 31 percent (213 dirham or USD $58) when it is observable to the migrant, compared to their reported monthly income of 685 dirham (USD $186) when it is not observable to the migrant. This underreporting is even greater when the migrant also participates in the study. Third, among both migrants and their spouses staying behind, women are more likely to underreport income. The majority of spouses staying behind are women, and they play a central role in driving the underreporting of income by spouses staying behind. These gender differences appear to be driven by women limiting misreporting by men by more frequently demanding control over and communicating about the household’s finances. Fourth, underreporting is greater when information is more difficult to observe and less likely to be verified. Spouses staying behind underreport income on the intensive margin by underreporting known sources of income instead of reporting zero income which would be easier for migrants to verify as misreporting. Underreporting only occurs when migrants do not demand control over or regularly communicate about the household’s finances, making them less likely to verify reported information. Together these reporting patterns are consistent with the theory that spouses staying behind strategically underreport their income to influence the remittance decision and this contributes to the information asymmetry between migrants and their spouses. </s>"
