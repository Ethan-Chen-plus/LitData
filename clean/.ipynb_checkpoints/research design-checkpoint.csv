The paper investigates the impact of the APRP, a major program of China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation strategy, on participating households' economic outcomes. It explores the economic logic behind the effects of the program, focusing on the comparative advantage in sectors, switching costs, and compensating differentials in amenities of residence. The study finds a positive average treatment effect on the treated, with substantial heterogeneity in the effects. It also identifies the critical mechanism that decreases the switching cost from the agricultural to the non-agricultural sector with a short-distance relocation.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {5：
A conceptual framework is thus adopted that accounts for the comparative advantage in sectors, switching costs, and compensating differential in amenities of residence to understand the APRP’s impact. Based on the conceptual framework, we hypothesize a positive average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of the APRP on participating households’ economic outcomes. A positive ATT arises because households with comparative advantage in the non-agricultural sector opt for the program and the program reduces switching costs across sectors by improving transportation conditions, access to non-agricultural job opportunities, and the propensity to migrate to other cities.

We test our theoretical predictions with a difference-in-differences (DID) method by utilizing comprehensive and fine-scale administrative panel data of 45,059 impoverished people in an impoverished county in China, comparing participants in the APRP with non-participants who are otherwise identically impoverished. Regarding the difference in the treatment and control groups, we use entropy balancing (Hainmueller, 2012) and inverse-probability-weighting methods (Wooldridge, 2010) in combination with post-double selection of controls (Belloni et al., 2014) to obtain a valid estimation of the ATT. We also incorporate a battery of robustness checks to establish causality, including the Oster test (Oster, 2019) and the permutation test, as well as controlling for other TPA programs and exploiting variation generated by the phase-in nature of the program.}} </s>"

This paper provides quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of group proliferation on the frequency and intensity of organized political violence. We exploit a unique setting in which the number of armed groups increases through a split of a separatist group that is plausibly exogenous to the conflict dynamics. Specifically, we exploit the split of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) into the BLA and United Baloch Army (UBA), operating primarily within districts of the Balochistan province in Pakistan. The split between the BLA and UBA goes back to a leadership dispute between two brothers who, in short, could not agree on the organization’s leadership. While disagreement between the brothers could be related to some unobserved conflict dynamics, the split of the BLA has the additional feature that the groups only effectively split after the father of the two brothers, who suppressed open conflict between them, died of natural causes following a relatively short and severe illness.
5：
The exogenous timing of the father’s death and the groups’ overlapping area of operations allows us to specify event studies and generalized difference-in-difference (DiD) specifications. We test if districts in which the BLA has traditionally been more active experience more violence following the split. Moreover, we use the DiD setup as a shift share instrument for the number of active armed groups operating within districts.

Our empirical analysis combines data from multiple publicly available data sources on political violence committed by the various armed groups within Pakistan. To measure the number of armed groups correctly, we systematically document all mergers and splits of armed groups in Pakistan between 1990 and 2018. Thus, we provide a unified analysis of organized political violence, including terrorism, guerilla warfare, as well as more symmetric forms of political violence. This allows us to test if armed groups change their strategies in response to increased competition. Recent theoretical and empirical work highlights that groups alter their strategies in response to changing constraints, of which increased competition could be an important factor.

Combining data on terrorism from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) (START, 2019) and political violence more broadly from the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) (Sundberg and Melander, 2013) allows us to increase coverage and proxy for government counter -insurgency efforts. We differentiate insurgency from counterinsurgency by exploiting the different inclusion criteria of events for each database. Accounting for counter-insurgency activity highlights that the violence is primarily driven by armed groups and not by the government’s reaction to the split of the BLA.}} </s>"

The paper examines the effect of growing up amid conflict on the development of reciprocal behavior among Palestinian adolescents.

In this paper, we present an observational study that employs experimental games to study the effect of growing up amid conflict on the development of reciprocal behavior, both in the domain of cooperation and in the domain of aggression. We provide evidence on a group of adolescents, a key period of life for the formation of reciprocal preferences (Blakemore, 2018), from a context of ongoing conflict. The study was conducted with 1,172 Palestinian adolescents in secondary education schools in the West Bank region of the Palestinian territories, some of whom are more exposed to a direct manifestation of the conflict than others: while occasionally crossing checkpoints is part of the daily life broadly of all Palestinians, some adolescents must regularly go through military checkpoints. The obligation comes from the location of checkpoints in between their home and the location of their school (which for public education, we show, is almost always the closest school, ruling out school choice sorting). Using a geographical sampling strategy of schools based on historical features pre-dating the checkpoints appearance, we minimize the concern that differences in behavior pick up pre-existing differences related to the non-random location of checkpoints.

We employ public good games to measure reciprocity in the domain of cooperation, using the methodology adopted by Fischbacher et al. (2001). We use vendetta games, two player interactive tasks where retaliation can but need not arise, as a natural and simple way to measure reciprocity in the domain of aggression. Crossing checkpoints, which may be manned by armed military personnel, is associated with higher exposure to physical violence and verbal abuse.1 Our hypotheses on the effects of checkpoint crossing on reciprocity are therefore informed by findings in social psychology concerning aggression and experiences of violence: a set of established findings suggest that exposure to violence may strengthen reciprocal preferences by lowering the threshold for perceiving the behavior of other agents as hostile (e.g. Novaco and Chemtob, 1998; Schwartz and Proctor, 2000; Guerra et al., 2003). Informed by this work, we investigate one potential mechanism of changes in reciprocal behavior: changes in the beliefs’ about other people’s behavior, by collecting incentivized information about the subjective beliefs about the behavior of classmates.}} </s>"

The paper examines the long-term impacts of exposure to wartime sexual violence against women on the propensity of male veterans to commit intimate partner violence.

Theoretically, it is a priori unclear whether a man ’s exposure to collective sexual violence against women increases or decreases his long-run propensity to commit IPV. We propose and test five theoretical mechanisms: a shift in traditional norms of gender identity and re lations, the creation of violent models, a decrease in self-control, psychological distress, and a reduction in intra-household bargaining power.

Testing the causal net relationship and the underlying mechanisms presents considerable data and identification challenges. First, high quality micro-level data on conflict experiences beyond exposure to battle-field violence are scarce (Brück et al., 2016). Second, unobserved individual-level factors may vary simultaneouslywith wartime exposure to sexual violence and domestic violence today. To overcome the data challenges, we collected detailed primary survey data on exposure to wartime sexual violence from 578 Angolan war veterans, and on IPV today from their intimate partners4 as part of a larger mixed-method research project. To establish causality, we rely on a natural experiment in Huambo province, the epicenter of the 1975 –2002 Angolan Civil War.

Our survey dataset includes detailed information on war and military service experiences, pre-service background characteristics and postwar social behaviors in 2014. The questionnaire was strongly informed by twelve months of ethnographic research into social behaviors and wartime experiences among ex-combatants in Huambo province (Spall, 2015). To reduce bias from self-reporting committed acts of IPV, we rely on information from the man’s partner, collected in separate but simultaneous, private interviews with a femaleenumerator, and based on standard Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) protocols and survey instruments.
8：
Our identification strategy exploits that the Angolan war created exogenous variation in how likelyit was that an individualsoldier would be exposed to wartime sexual violence against women. The war was characterized by mass militarization and military competition between two high-capacity actors, the Movimento Popular de Liberta? ? ao de Angola (MPLA) government and the Uni ? ao Nacional para a Independ?encia Total de Angola (UNITA) rebels. Throughout the war, both sides used their institutional capacity to enforce compulsory military service for all men at (approximately) the age of 20 in territoriesunder their control, which changed often and extensively during the war. Universal conscription exogenously selected individuals into different military entry dates (based on their date of birth)and different armed groups (due to shiftsin territorial control).
9:
Specifically, we exploit that for a specific subset of the armed group and date of birth combinations the ex-ante risk of exposure to sexual violence was much higher than for all others. While most of the time levels of sexual violence were low for both groups, there were two brief spikes in wartime sexual violence by MPLA, which were more than two?decades apart (one in the late 1970s and one in the late 1990s). The natural recruitment experiment thus suggests that men born about 20 years before one of the two spikes and recruited into MPLA (the “highrisk group ”) were at a much higher risk of exposure than all other combinations of birth dates and armed groups.}} </s>"

The paper uses a field experiment in Johannesburg, South Africa to examine the impact of reducing search costs on job-seekers' learning and employment outcomes.
The paper explores the interaction between search costs and beliefs in the context of high youth unemployment rates in developing economies. It finds that reducing search costs leads to more intensive job search, revised beliefs, and a shift in job preferences towards lower-paying jobs in the job-seekers' own township.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {3:
Our experiment takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa, a country where high estimated youth unemployment coexists with strong demand for labour (Banerjee et al., 2008).3 Like a growing number of cities in the developing world, Johannesburg combines limited transport infrastructure with a spatial mismatch between jobs and low-income job-seekers, which results in very high search costs.4 Our sample consists of 1082 job-seekers in a large township in the outskirts of Johannesburg, aged between 18 and 32, who have completed at least secondary education, and who are actively searching for jobs.
4：
We begin by documenting a striking optimism bias among jobseekers with respect to entry-level jobs: expected salaries at baseline are on average 1.7 times higher than the actual average salaries reported by employed individuals in the region with similar skills and age profiles. This bias appears to be driven mostly by an overestimation of the probability of getting into entry-level jobs in high-paying occupations, as opposed to inaccurate information about the entry-level wages for each type of job: 75% of job-seekers reported looking for a professional job, even though the actual probability of getting a professional job for an individual with a similar age and skill profile is only 11%.6 Moreover, respondents are also over-confident: they believe that their own starting salary is likely to be on average twice as large as the salary of job-seekers in their township who have a similar skill profile. In fact, respondents are optimistic across the board since they overestimate the probability of getting any type of job — 62% of them believe that it is likely or very likely that they will find a job within 2 months, despite having been on the job search for an average of 15 months. In this sense, our sample is similar to samples drawn from other labour force surveys in South Africa, which show average search time for jobs of 12 months or longer and high general levels of optimism (ILOSTAT, 2015; StatsSA, 2015).7 Since search costs for the city centre jobs they aspire to are high, search intensity is low and learning remains slow.
5:Our field experiment has three key features. First, we release the transport constraint by providing job search subsidies to a subset of randomly selected job-seekers and observe their search activity through the main bus rapid transit (BRT) network connecting the township to the city centre. Within the subsidy group, we randomize whether the recipient can decide to use the subsidy on anything other than transport.8 Second, we elicit beliefs about a range of aspects relevant to the job search, including the level of skill required for different types of jobs and associated wages, as well as beliefs about the key binding constraints to finding a job such as skills and transport costs. Importantly, we measure beliefs before, and twelve months after, the job search subsidy intervention. Third, we measure several features of the job search including the frequency of travel to the city centre, as well as employment decisions. The structure of the experiment helps us understand how search experience shapes beliefs and how beliefs drive subsequent employment decisions.}} </s>"

Our main research design involves an event study analysis spanning 1985 through 2005.

To construct a measure of each county’s exposure to treatment, we combine information on baseline plant efficiency, sulfur control installations (e.g., sulfur scrubbers), and atmospheric migration of SO2. Since evidence suggests PM2.5 drives mortality effects, we use a model of pollution transport to project how SO2 disperses to form PM2.5 across the country (Muller et al., 2014). This treatment variable provides a basis for a difference-in-differences model with varying exposure intensity. We estimate the dynamic, reduced-form effects of the ARP, tracing out the effects of the policy for up to 10 years, while also testing for pre-trends in mortality leading up to the ARP as a check on identifying assumptions.}} </s>"

The paper finds that gender-focused sanitation interventions, such as the TSC, can change marriage market outcomes in India. It shows that the TSC led to a significant increase in sanitation ownership among households active in the marriage market, particularly when the prospective spouse is male. The impact is larger in marriage markets where women are relatively scarce. The paper also highlights the redistribution of gains across matched types and within marriages due to the TSC.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {5:
We develop and estimate a structural model that allows us to decompose and quantify this overall policy impact on marital sorting, marital surplus, and the division of that surplus among partners, thereby identifying the overall importance of sanitation in the marriage market. Our model of the marriage market uses a simple matching framework under transferable utility à la Choo and Siow (2006), in which prospective spouses match based on their wealth type. To allow for changes in the composition of who marries whom, and for differential unobserved marital preference, men and women simultaneously choose their spouse and whether the new living arrangement includes sanitation or not. In other words, prospective spouses decide not only whether to marry, and whom to marry, but also the type of living arrangement they want to share. Allowing for different types of living arrangements delivers an empirically tractable marital surplus function that permits sorting based on unobserved tastes for sanitation. We extend the framework to multiple markets using districts, and exploit variation over time (before and after TSC exposure) to achieve model identification.}} </s>"

The paper uses a randomized controlled trial design to test the effects of different interventions on sanitation adoption and maintenance in rural Bangladesh.
The paper explores social and financial incentives to overcome the collective action problem of open defecation in rural Bangladesh. It tests different interventions, including monetary rewards, recognition rewards, public commitments, and private commitments, to encourage households to adopt and maintain hygienic latrines.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {3：
In this paper, we test several such tools designed to overcome this collective action problem in rural Bangladesh, a setting where social?and financial incentives to encourage sanitation adoption and maintenance are a promising alternative to command-and-control approaches. The interventions were designed to help groups of households overcome collective action failures impeding investment and maintenance of hygienic latrines. All participating households are grouped with 1520 neighbors who jointly participate in monthly meetings for 3 months with a health worker from a well-known NGO to discuss sanitation, OD and disease risk. On top of this common treatment, we randomize four additional treatments and study their effects.
4：
The first treatment, a group ‘‘monetary reward’’, is a slight variation on the standard public finance policy prescription: a subsidy for a well-maintained hygienic latrine. The non-standard component is an element of joint liability: households receive the reward only if both that household’s latrine is hygienic and a certain share of all households in the group maintain a hygienic latrine. Given the financial sustainability concerns about such payments, we substitute a recognition certificate from the local government instead of money as our second treatment, and call this a ‘‘recognition reward’’. The same element of joint group liability is also present for this treatment, and only the form of the reward is changed. This treatment is more akin to certifications like open-defection-free (ODF) status sometimes conferred by governments to encourage investments in improved sanitation.
5：
Our third treatment, ‘‘public commitment’’, explores whether a simple verbal coordination device between neighbors can sustain a cooperative equilibrium (Schelling, 1960). In public commitment groups, all households in the group are asked to make a joint public (but nonbinding) commitment in front of each other, stating that they will try to address the OD issue in their neighborhood by using and maintaining hygienic latrines. This public commitment could be operating through two mechanisms. First, the act of making a commitment is an ‘‘implementation intention’’ that can itself spur action (Gollwitzer and Brandst?tter, 1997). Second, the fact that this commitment is made in public in front of and with others who are making the same commitment simultaneously can help coordinate action. Our fourth treatment, ‘‘private commitment’’, was designed to separate these two mechanisms. In this arm, all group members are asked to make the same pledge as those in the public commitment arm, but this pledge is made in private only to the NGO health worker, so that it activates the implementation intention without offering the direct coordination device for neighbors.
6：
These interventions are implemented between November 2013 and February 2014, covering 19,271 households in 107 villages in rural Tanore sub-district (upazila), Rajshahi district (zila), Bangladesh. Note that while our interventions are not household-specific and instead focused on groups and joint liability, the popular and sensible technology for this context is a private household-specific latrine, not a latrine that is shared between unrelated neighbors. We measure shortterm (at the time of the assessment for rewards, roughly 3 months after the interventions began) and medium-term (12–15 months after assessment) effects of the treatments on private, household-specific sanitation investments and maintenance. Earlier, between April and June 2012, we had tested a broader set of demand and supply-side interventions to also encourage investment in hygienic latrines in this same location (Guiteras et al., 2015). The group commitments and joint incentives – which are the focus of this study – were implemented around one and a half years after the interventions described in Guiteras et al. (2015) were completed. We conduct all our analysis controlling for sanitation ownership in June 2013 (which acts as the baseline for this study), which is a full year after the earlier round of interventions were completed, so household exposure to those earlier treatments should not materially affect the comparison between our new treatments reported in this paper.
7：
Another distinguishing characteristic of this study is that while our earlier research primarily focused on the initial sanitation investment decision, we now carefully measure proper use and maintenance beyond the initial adoption. Sustaining intervention effects has been an important challenge for the sanitation sector (Coffey et al., 2014; OrgillMeyer et al., 2019; Pakhtigian et al., 2021; Deutschmann et al., 2021). Hygienic latrines only produce health benefits if they are consistently used and are kept in good condition so that fecal pathogens are safely isolated from the environment. This requires each household to incur time and materials costs to keep the latrine clean, conduct maintenance and dispose of waste properly.}} </s>"

The paper uses a macroeconomic model to analyze the trade-off between lives and livelihoods during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically focusing on the differences in policy responses between rich and poor countries.
The paper argues that poor countries were justified in imposing equally harsh restrictions as rich countries due to their close proximity to subsistence constraints and the increasing value of lives relative to income in poorer countries.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {2：
In this paper, we ask whether poor countries were justified in imposing equally harsh restrictions as rich countries – despite fewer demographic risk factors and lower ability to weather economic shocks. We show that these similar policy responses between rich and poor countries can be rationalized by extending a standard macroeconomic model, with feedback between the economy and the pandemic, to allow for the trade-off between lives and livelihoods to vary by income.1 Empirical patterns are consistent with the model predictions under two, very reasonable, conditions: (a) poor countries are close to their subsistence constraint below which consumption cannot fall, and (b) the valuation of lives versus income is increasing in income which means that at the margin, poor countries value lives relative to income more than rich countries.
3:
Our analysis starts from the model of Eichenbaum et al. (2021), henceforth ERT, in which agents expose themselves to infection risk?when working and consuming, and, realizing this danger, reduce economic activity as infection risk rises. However, they do not weigh the impact of their own labor and consumption decisions on the pandemic’s spread, creating an externality which the social planner seeks to internalize. The model allows for a policy lever in the form of a value-added tax on consumption, discouraging economic activity and hence slowing disease transmission. The policymaker chooses the tax to maximize the present value of aggregate utility, taking into account utility losses from both reduced consumption and lost lives.
4：
We generalize ERT’s model by incorporating two features that may drive differences in optimal policy between countries at different income levels and with different fatality risk from COVID-19: a subsistence constraint, and varying values of a statistical life (VSL). First, to capture the intuition that poorer people may be less able to reduce their economic activity during the pandemic than richer counterparts, we introduce a subsistence constraint below which consumption cannot fall. Second, we also allow the trade-off between consumption and catching a potentially deadly infection to vary by income. That is, the VSL will always be lower in poorer countries, but the VSL-income ratio may not. Specifically, we allow the VSL to be a non-linear function of income and show that optimal policy depends crucially on the incomeelasticity of the VSL, as the social planner trades off risks of deaths against the utility of the living. We estimate both these parameters, i.e. the subsistence constraint and the income-elasticity of the VSL, using indirect inference.}} </s>"

To quantify the political costs of land expropriation, I focus mainly on two outcomes: individuals’ trust towards local government officials (‘‘political trust’’) and whether individuals experienced conflicts with local government officials (‘‘political conflict’’). These two outcomes are important for several reasons. First, political trust is the foundation for political support and regime legitimacy (Newton et al., 2018). Second, both political trust and political conflict are critical to government efficiency, especially the effectiveness of policy implementation. For instance, Bargain and Aminjonov (2020) show that the compliance with public health policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in different European countries depends on the level of political trust prior to the crisis. Last but not least, using these two measures, this study investigates how both political attitudes and behavior are shaped by government expropriation. The political consequences of land expropriation identified in this paper also are informative for understanding the political situation in today’s China.

I construct a national individual-level panel data set from the CFPS with more than 8,000 households and 25,000 individuals for the period 2010–2018, which enables me to exploit rich variation in China’s land expropriation. In the sample, I only include rural villages, i.e., those that have a village committee (Chinese: Cunweihui). This is to ensure that the control group include only households and individuals that have agricultural land and thus are ‘‘eligible’’ for treatment.7 This paper focuses on state expropriation of agricultural land of rural households not programs such as housing demolition that mostly occur in urban areas and typically provide much more generous compensation. In the data, land expropriation occurs at different periods for different households, I thus employ a generalized difference-in-differences approach that compares changes in individual’s political trust or political conflict before and after experiencing land expropriation with changes among individuals not experiencing expropriation during the same period.

Before our intervention, two schools in this study ?had no functioning toilets available to students. Those schools that did have functioning toilets had only one for every 226 students, far below the internationally recommended minimum standard of 1:50 (Water Aid, 2016). Only 61% of functioning toilets were clean and could be locked. No school had any toilet meeting the minimum requirements for safe and private menstrual hygiene management (MHM). Students and teachers reported that inadequate sanitation facilities affected female student attendance.

We randomly assigned 30 schools to receive the intervention we study. Developed by the Water Integrity Network (WIN) and the IRC International Water and Sanitation Centre, the Annotated Water Integrity Scan (AWIS) is a participatory assessment tool designed to gather and disseminate information, improve governance, and promote integrity.3 Integrity is defined as a set of practices that impede corruption and promote respect for the rule of law. During a workshop, participants first anonymously score WASH service provision across indicators measuring transparency, accountability, and participation. Facilitators then reveal the anonymized scores. When scores differ across participants, facilitators invite them to discuss why, with the goal of understanding differences in opinions rather than defending individual positions. The output of this stage of the discussion is a single, unified set of scores. This process is designed to yield a common understanding of challenges with the goal of identifying concrete and specific priority actions for improvement during the last phase of the workshop. AWIS closely resembles one of a set of ‘‘exemplary transparency interventions’’ identified by Kosack and Fung (2014).4}} </s>"

Identifying the causal effects of female leaders on violence is challenging because there could be municipality characteristics that correlate with the likelihood of having a female leader and violence against women. Therefore, we apply a regression discontinuity (RD) design focusing on close elections in Brazilian municipalities (2004–2016), assuming that municipalities where a female candidate won against a man by a narrow margin represent a good counterfactual for those municipalities where the opposite occurred (i.e., a male candidate won against a woman by a narrow margin) (Barbosa, 2017, Lee et al., 2004).}} </s>"

Similar to Iyer et al. (2012) and Ghani et al. (2014), the methodology used in this paper also relies on the timing of state-level implementation of female political seat reservations. Exploiting variation both in the timing of when a state had its first Panchayat elections (effectively the first time seats for women were reserved) and in the birth order of children, I estimate a difference-in-differences (DD) model. The model investigates birth order-specific effects because sex selection is known to increase disproportionately at higher birth orders.3 Prior to female seat reservations, my sample consists of 117 boys per 100 girls at birth orders 3 and greater, 107 boys per 100 girls at the second birth order, and 106 boys per 100 girls at the first birth order. I find that higher birth order children born in rural India following a Panchayat election that reserved seats for women are less likely to be male, while there is no evidence that sex ratios changed for second and first-born children. The estimates imply that post-reservations, there are between 6 to 12 fewer boys per 100 girls at birth orders 3 and greater in rural India. These effects are large and imply an increased survival of approximately 900,000 to 1,800,000 high birth order girls over the course of the study.}} </s>"

Identifying the effects of female leaders on policy outcomes is challenging because of municipality-specific factors that are related both to the presence of female leaders and the outcomes. To avoid biases caused by these factors, we implement a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design focusing on mixed-gender races. This method allows us to identify the effect of electing a female mayor on COVID-19 outcomes by comparing municipalities where a female candidate won against a male one by a narrow margin with the ones where the opposite occurred. To provide complementary evidence on our findings we estimate the effect of electing a female mayor using a dynamic local difference-in-difference approach using quarterly data and compare hospitalizations and deaths caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) in municipalities with male and female mayors relatively to the figures before the COVID-19 outbreak.

We perform a series of robustness checks. First, we document very similar point estimates using SARI deaths and hospitalizations as dependent variables, which are less likely to suffer from non-classical measurement error caused by strategic under reporting since they do not depend on a positive COVID-19 test for a diagnosis. Second, our point estimates are very similar using linear and quadratic RD polynomials and different bandwidths.1 Third, our estimates using a local difference-in-difference comparing changes in SARI outcomes before and after the pandemic outbreak in municipalities with males and females mayors provide qualitatively similar results.}} </s>"

The identification strategy used in this paper is to compare the outcomes before and after a change in the percentage of women in the Executive Committees (ECs) of Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) in Nepal. This change occurred in 2009 when the government set a minimum threshold of 50 percent female representation in the ECs.
The core story of this paper is to analyze the impact of increased female participation in decision-making bodies of local collective action institutions on forest protection, specifically the quantity of firewood collected by households in Nepal. The paper argues that women have different and complementary interests in forest management compared to men, and their increased representation can lead to better forest conservation and equity in the distribution of benefits.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {7：
To account for the potential endogeneity of female representation I exploit the fact that in groups formed after 2009, the percentage of women in the Executive Committees is higher than in groups formed before and compare the outcome before and after this change, as an identification strategy.

This evidence is suggestive that women are prioritising conservation to ensure sustainable firewood extraction to satisfy their daily needs.}} </s>"

The paper examines the impact of the gender of the policymaker on corruption in Brazilian municipalities.

However, male mayors are more likely to be reelected due to their involvement in patronage and ability to attract more campaign donations.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {3：
We contribute to this literature by providing novel evidence on the causal effect of the gender of the policymaker on corruption in the municipal administration using an Regression Discontinuity (RD) design. Instead of relying on survey measures of corruption, we use an objective measure of irregularities in government contracts and purchases based on random audits of local administrations. We find that female mayors are less likely to be involved in administrative irregularities. We also analyze gender differences along two other dimensions that may also be related to corrupt practices at the local level, which have not been explored before in the gender literature.1 First, we analyze employment in the municipal administration, which can provide some insights about the use of patronage. We find that male mayors tend to hire more temporary public employees during the electoral year, which is a standard way to engage in patronage in Latin America (Kemahlioglu, 2013). Second, we analyze gender differences in terms of campaign contributions. Political donations may allow private interests to gain influence over elected officials (Strauss, 1999, Ansolabehere, 2007) and the empirical evidence from Brazil shows that firms that contribute to the campaigns of winning candidates experience significant increases in government contracts (Boas et al., 2014). We find that women receive fewer campaign contributions than men, potentially consistent with our corruption results.
12:
A key empirical challenge to identify the effect of the gender of the mayor on policy outcomes is that there may be municipality-specific factors that are correlated with both the gender of the mayor and policy outcomes. To control for municipality-specific confounding factors, we adopt a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) in mixed gender close electoral races. In this set-up, identification comes from comparing municipalities where a female candidate barely won an election against a male candidate with municipalities where the opposite occurred.9 Although this estimation strategy controls for municipality unobservable factors, it does not account for individual characteristics of the mayor. This could raise some concerns if male and female mayors differ in terms of individual characteristics that are relevant for policymaking.10 To alleviate this concern, common in the gender literature, we show that female and male mayors elected following close races are similar in terms of a wide range of observable characteristics, including education, political affiliation, and political experience.}} </s>"

The study uses a difference-in-differences identification strategy in a matched sample to analyze the long-term impact of the Soviet Union's aid program on Sino-Russian trade patterns. The strategy eliminates unobserved differences across Chinese cities and controls for overall trade volumes between foreign countries and China.
The paper examines the long-term effects of the Soviet Union's aid program, specifically the 156 Program, on contemporary Sino-Russian trade patterns. It proposes that aid can build social capital, such as affinity or trust, between donors and recipients, which facilitates long-term economic exchanges. The study provides empirical evidence and mechanisms to support this claim.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {4：Identifying the causal effect of aid on trade is challenging. The main difficulty comes from the non-random allocation of aid. In our context, however, the 156 Program chose the locations of aid projects according to explicit criteria (Bo, 1991). First, as the projects invested in heavy industries, regions with mineral resources and transportation capacity were prioritized. Second, to reduce spatial inequality, projects were more likely to be constructed in underdeveloped regions. Third, projects should be placed out of the reach of American bombers to enhance military security. We use a set of city-level variables to proxy for the site selection rules and match the recipient cities with control cities that have similar characteristics. To support that the selected control cities are a valid counterfactual for the recipient ones in the absence of aid, we compare the recipient and control cities across various variables that are untargeted in the matching procedure. We find insignificant differences between the two groups of cities in geographic, meteorologic, demographic, and political characteristics.

5:We then employ a difference-in-differences identification strategy in the matched sample. This compares contemporary Sino-Russian trade with the trade between China and countries other than Russia across Chinese cities with higher and lower aid intensity.4 In the main analysis, we measure city-level aid intensity by the total value of investment in the projects of the 156 Program. The DID strategy further eliminates all the unobserved differences across Chinese cities, which may correlate with aid intensity and affect trade with foreign countries. It also removes the differences in overall trade volumes between foreign countries and China. Combining the matching strategy and DID strategy, we thus interpret our empirical results as causal.

9：After establishing the association between aid and affinity, we adopt three approaches to demonstrate the potential of affinity in explaining the higher Sino-Russian trade in recipient cities. First, we follow the method proposed by Rauch (1999) and divide tradable goods into differentiated goods and non-differentiated goods. Heterogenous analysis suggests that Soviet aid only significantly increases Sino-Russian trade in differentiated goods, which rely more on trust during the transaction process. Second, Soviet aid decreases recipient cities' trade with countries ideologically opposite to the Soviet Union and increases trade with countries ideologically close to the Soviet Union. We interpret the finding as a salient prediction of the affinity mechanism. Third, the sudden withdrawal of Soviet experts in 1960 caused some projects in the 156 Program to be finished construction by China's own efforts. Specifically, the remaining construction was conducted during the split period when China launched anti-Soviet propaganda. We estimate the differential effects of the projects by project completion year and find that projects completed after the split yield negative effects on Sino-Russian trade. The finding is considered as evidence for the affinity mechanism from the other direction.6 We note that each single exercise is open to other interpretations, but these findings, derived from independent perspectives, can be collectively rationalized by the affinity mechanism. This leads us to believe in the importance of affinity in driving the Sino-Russian trade in recipient cities. Lastly, we lay out a discussion of other potential mechanisms, such as the persistence of industrial linkages and information.}} </s>"

The paper examines the long-term effects of British and French colonial practices on female economic empowerment and intimate partner violence (IPV) in Cameroon. It finds that British colonial rule led to higher female employment and empowerment, but also increased IPV risk. The results suggest a male backlash effect, where men resort to violence when their partners' economic opportunities increase.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {3:This setting provides us with a unique opportunity to examine whether and how policies promoting female empowerment affect women's lives in the long-term. We focus on two questions: Did the divergent opportunities that opened up for women when Cameroon was split into a French and a British colony have a long-term impact on female participation in activities outside the household, especially in the labor market, that persists until today? Given that women's employment status has been linked to domestic violence in numerous settings worldwide, does Cameroon's colonial past continue to influence women's treatment within the household nowadays, especially in terms of intimate partner violence (henceforth, IPV)?

4：To get at these questions, we use the historical Anglo-French border in present day's Cameroon in a spatial regression discontinuity (RD) design. Our analysis draws upon two repeated cross sections (2004, 2011) of the Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), which contains geolocated household survey data and a domestic violence module, completed by one randomly selected woman per surveyed household. Because the validity of our spatial RD design rests on continuity of all factors besides treatment at the historical Anglo-French border, we match ethnic groups in the DHS with information on ancestral anthropological and cultural group characteristics from Murdock's Ethnographic Atlas. Specification checks show that these ancestral characteristics, some of which have been shown to correlate with women's current outcomes (Alesina et al. (2016)), do not vary across the historical Anglo-French border. We also provide evidence suggesting that selective migration across the treatment threshold poses no threat to identification.}} </s>"

The paper investigates whether equal inheritance rights for women in India modify the historic preference for sons. It explores the potential mechanisms through which equal inheritance rights may mellow the preference for sons, such as providing old-age security and reducing dowry costs. The paper finds that the inheritance reform increased female foeticide and son-biased fertility stopping behavior, indicating an intensification of son preference.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {5:In this paper, we investigate this issue by modelling the sex ratio at birth as a function of whether the inheritance reform in the state of birth had been passed before the year of birth. To identify causal effects of equal inheritance rights for women, we leverage the staggered implementation of the inheritance reform across the Indian states, which created state and cohort-level variation in reform exposure, similar, for instance, to Miller (2008). We buttress this double difference using two further sources of variation that determine the degree of exposure to the reform. First, we interact the inheritance reform indicator with a cohort-varying indicator for availability of ultrasound technology. Previous work shows ultrasound availability generated a trend break in the sex ratio at birth (Bhalotra and Cochrane, 2010). We exploit the fact that prior to the introduction of ultrasound technology that made prenatal detection of the sex of the foetus feasible, no significant manipulation of the sex ratio at birth is discernible in aggregate statistics (Bhalotra and Cochrane, 2010). So, for the sex ratio at birth to have responded to the reform, the indicator for ultrasound access will need to have switched on. This aids identification because any omitted variables that drive a spurious relationship between the outcome variables and inheritance reform would have to have exhibited a discontinuous change that not only lines up with the particular state and year variation in reform (i.e. in the state of Kerala in 1976, in Andhra Pradesh in 1986 and so on) but, in addition, the omitted variables would have to have jumped in line with the date of introduction of ultrasound scans as well. Moreover, crossing the reform and ultrasound indicators helps us attribute any observed effects to parental manipulation of the sex ratio.

6：The final source of variation deployed towards identification is the sex of the firstborn child. Previous work shows that this is a) quasi-random and b) that it predicts sex-selective abortion in favour of male children: parents who, by the random hand of nature, are assigned a son at first birth are significantly less likely to engage in female foeticide for subsequent conceptions (see Almond et al. forthcoming; Almond and Edlund, 2008; Abrevaya, 2009; Bhalotra and Cochrane, 2010; Anukriti et al., 2016).3 We also show that families with firstborn sons and families with firstborn daughters are balanced on all relevant observable characteristics.

7：To summarize, the treated group is defined as a cohort born post-reform and post-ultrasound in a family with a firstborn daughter. The control group includes families with firstborn sons and children born pre-reform or pre-ultrasound. We corroborate our findings of changes in sex-selective abortion behaviour using data on reported son preference (i.e. desired share of sons among births). We conclude with an attempt to investigate whether passage of the reform was associated with changes in patriarchal norms, in particular, whether daughters married closer to the natal home, and whether adult sons changed their propensity to co-reside with parents.}} </s>"

Also, the approach requires that identification come through differential changes for states on one border versus another that are appropriately timed with the adoption of reservations. However, the approach may not isolate the impact of the reservations from other changes that states may have made with similar timing. Thus, if the political reservations were consistently bundled into a package of reforms implemented by states (e.g., alongside large independent investments in women's education), the border approach will not be able to differentiate the specific role of the reservations.}} </s>"

This article follows two representative approaches introduced by Schlenker and Roberts (2009) in panel regressions: 1) a simple piecewise linear function of temperature and construct the variables of growing degree days (GDDs) below and above a selected threshold and 2) more specific temperature bins that calculate the accumulation of heat for each 3–6 ?°C temperature interval. The simultaneous variations in additional weather variables, such as rainfall, sunshine duration, humidity, and wind force are also taken into account (Zhang et al., 2017). Panel estimates suggest that piecewise linear function yields results similar to those estimated using more complicated functional forms. An increase in exposure to temperatures above 33 ?°C results in sharp declines in agricultural TFPs. We use the same methods to evaluate the impact of climate change on yield (measured by unit land output value) and find it to be more negative than the impact on agricultural TFP, as we expected, since extreme hot weather may also lower input utilization in the short run.

Facilitated by a set of comprehensive firm-level loan data, we are able to perform these analyses. The loan data are provided by one of China's “Big Five” banks covering firms in 31 provinces with different credit ratings, sizes, ownership types and sectoral distributions. The data record detailed information about each loan issued to firms. Therefore, our analysis is about loaning to all firms rather than the loans with specific environmental ends. This study relates to how banks integrate firms' environmental risks into the loan issuing process when lending to dirty firms which is subject to the environmental laws and regulations.
4：
In this research, we intend to find out how financial markets internalize the potential adverse cost of firm's environmental credit risk on the margins of a borrowing firm, and how the increased loan costs further affect firms' economic and environmental performance. To begin, we build a static model, in which firms can autonomously choose to abate the pollution or not. At the same time, in order to maximize their profits, banks choose the optimal float rate of loans over the benchmark interest rate set by the central bank. When the enforcement of green loan regulations is strengthened, banks increase their loan rates to firms without abatement. As a result, a new cutoff of firm productivity emerges for those indifferent to pollution abatement since firms without abatement will face greater financing cost. We derive several testable propositions from the model. First, more stringent green loan regulations induce large, incompliant firms to adopt abatement technologies and their loans are thus less impacted by the policy. However, for small firms that are still unwilling to improve their environmental performance, their loan cost will be substantially and positively affected. Second, in regard to the economic performance, the negative impact of the green credit policy on firms' sales and investments is stronger for small nonabatement firms. Third, when it comes to the environmental performance, although all of these firms have reduced their pollution emissions, this effect is stronger for large firms. Furthermore, only large non-abatement firms decrease their pollution by investing in abatement technology.

To test these predictions, we construct a rich firm-level dataset. We draw from multiple sources: firm-level economic data from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF); bank loan data from one of China's five largest state-owned commercial banks; firm-level pollution data from the Annual Environmental Survey of Polluting Firms (AESPF); and firms' environmental penalty data from the Dataset on Environmental Penalty. The merged dataset contains information on 130,000 unique firm loans, accounting for approximately half of the total loan value issued to manufacturing firms by banks and covering firms with different credit ratings in all provinces, firms of differing sizes and ownership characteristics, and firms operating in different sectors.}} </s>"

The study's analyses exploit a compelling quasi-experiment: changes in standards for fuel sold in Chinese cities. According to official statistics from China's Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), exhaust from motor vehicles contributes a quarter to a third of particulate matter (PM) air pollution throughout the country (MEP, 2013). Against this background, since 2013 China has gradually tightened its gasoline standards, followed by diesel standards upgrading in certain cities. The introduction of low-sulfur fuel has aimed at reducing emissions from the motor vehicle fleet substantially, and the regulations need to be strictly enforced by the retailers.

The study's analyses involve merging data on prefecture-level regulations with hourly pollution data from 1492 air quality monitoring stations in 337 prefectures for the three years 2013–2015. In addition to the air quality index (AQI), a composite measure of pollution, data on suspended particulates less than 10 μm in diameter (PM10) and less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and on ozone (O3) concentrations are analyzed. Those pollutants are particularly related to fuel composition, and are among the most harmful to human health. This then marks the first time that high-quality data on fine particulates and ozone have been used to research Chinese environmental issues (Pope and Dockery, 2013).
7：
We focus on precisely estimating the effect on air pollution of the first change in gasoline standards implemented during the period studied. Two estimation strategies are applied. In the first, both temporal and geographic variations in the implementation of the new gasoline standard are exploited to identify its effects. The empirical analysis compares daily changes in the local concentrations of air pollutants between prefectures implementing the new standard earlier (the treatment group) and later (the control group). The validity of the difference-in-differences (DD) methods applied and the causal interpretation of the results rely on the assumption that prefectures that adopted the new standard later are proper counterfactuals for what would have happened to earlier adopters in the absence of the change. A large number of other variables are included in the analyses, including monitoring station fixed effects, day fixed effects, station-specific seasonality, weather conditions, fuel prices and subsequent changes in fuel quality standards. It is also necessary to remove the confounding influence of other on-going policies aimed at curbing air pollution by directly controlling for them. To further address the selected nature of the enforcement dates, we control for the differences in the trends in outcomes between early adopters and later ones depending on the key determinants in the timing of the fuel standard changes (i.e., the historical pollution level and growth), a technique used by Gentzkow (2006). Beyond that, a series of robustness tests verify that the treatment and control prefectures are comparable in terms of their pre-regulation trends in the outcomes.

The study's second set of analyses follows the lead of work by Davis (2008) and by Auffhammer and Kellogg (2011) and the review by Hausman and Rapson (2018). A regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) framework is applied to identify the effect of gasoline standards on air pollution. After the new regulations came into force, all the retailers in the treatment prefectures were assumed to have immediately switched to supplying only gasoline meeting the new standards. That is assumed to have created a discontinuity in tailpipe emissions. In effect, the abrupt change makes other factors smooth on the day of implementation of the new regulations, so the day just before the new regulations can serve as a good counterfactual to the day the new regulations came into force. To validate concerns about causal identifications in the RDiT context, serial correlation in the daily pollutant data is evaluated to recover both the short-run and long-run policy effects. In addition, a number of auxiliary sensitivity checks provide reassuring results.}} </s>"

In so doing, we exploit an underlying geographic characteristic, namely storms in islands, as a natural experiment.5 Our setting is intended to capture the random variation in the timing (i.e., the year of incidence) and intensity (i.e., their frequency as well as physical severity) of storm exposure in affected island countries compared with their storm-free counterparts.

As disasters rarely affect a country's entire territorial space, it is generally challenging to determine their average treatment effect on a national outcome, such as the level of democracy.6 Island countries help to address this pitfall, in that major storms tend to traverse a large part of their territories, especially for relatively small islands such as Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Fiji. This results in a large constituency being exposed, or ‘treated’, thus making such islands a viable cluster for unmasking the average treatment effect on the national outcome of interest.

7：We employ a generalized difference-in-differences (DID) approach with multiple treatments over time to compare the levels of democracy in island countries with and without storms. The validity of our identification strategy relies on the evidence that many island countries are victims of major storms (most notably, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Haiti, and Madagascar experience severe storms regularly), while several others are spared storms due to their geographic locations (e.g., Iceland and Singapore experienced no storms between 1950 and 2020).

8：We account for unobserved heterogeneity in the storm–polity nexus by relying on the fact that storms are exogenous shocks: they strike randomly in terms of both timing and intensity. Even if politicians expect storms in a given year based on a country's storm history, they cannot predict their frequency or severity in that year. The triggering factors of storms—e.g., wind patterns and the ocean surface temperature—are hardly predictable in the medium- and long-term: a storm typically originates in the ocean due to variations in its surface temperature, and its route is determined by the wind speed and direction. These factors are exogenous to both economic and political outcomes.

9：We achieve comparability between storm-prone and storm-free countries by accounting for an array of permanent differences across countries through controlling for country-fixed effects. We also control for year-fixed effects to help neutralize any shocks experienced by all countries. Moreover, we isolate the long-term path of political conditions (which might be driven, for example, by countries’ locations or colonial history) by controlling for country-specific linear time trends. Once time-invariant country differences, year-fixed effects, and country-specific trends are all controlled for, the two country groups become reasonably comparable, at least initially, and the remaining variation in the model is likely to yield a credible average treatment effect of storms.}} </s>"

The paper uses a difference-in-difference research design to identify the effects of maize on precolonial Africa. It compares outcomes from countries with large amounts of maize-suitable land to outcomes from countries with small amounts of maize-suitable land, before and after maize was introduced into Africa.
The paper examines the effects of crop movements during the Columbian Exchange on precolonial Africa, specifically focusing on the introduction of maize. It tests the Crosby-Curtin Hypothesis that suggests maize increased both population density and slave exports in Africa. The paper finds robust evidence supporting this hypothesis.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {5：While the population effects of maize envisioned by Crosby and Curtin follow directly from the Malthusian forces present in Africa during the Columbian Exchange, the link to slavery is less obvious. As such, the first step in our analysis is to develop a simple theoretical framework to illustrate how these same Malthusian forces may have also increased slave exports. Our starting point for this exercise is the Malthusian growth model featuring endogenous slavery developed by Lagerlof (2009). This model is well suited for our purposes; as highlighted by Fenske (2013), the Lagerlof (2009) model matches several key stylized facts about African societies during the Columbian Exchange. In the original Lagerlof framework, ruling political elites choose property rights for land and labor to maximize their payoff, and the incentive to enslave people to work in agriculture is increasing in the productivity of land. We adapt this framework to allow for the possibility that the elites sell slaves to foreign markets. This alters the effects of an increase in agricultural productivity; while the elite's incentive to keep slaves to work in domestic agriculture increases, decreasing returns to agriculture mean that the relative return to exporting slaves also increases. Thus, an agricultural productivity shock, such as that created by the introduction of New World Crops, will increase both the population density of and slave exports from an affected country.

6：The second step in our analysis is to test the predictions of the Crosby-Curtin Hypothesis empirically. We start by examining which New World crops, if any, could have created the change in agricultural productivity envisioned by Crosby and Curtin. Such a crop needs to satisfy three conditions. First, it must have had enough calories and nutrients to function as a primary dietary source. Second, it must have had a higher yield than existing African staples, so its adoption would have resulted in an increase in agricultural productivity. Finally, it must have been introduced and widely adopted in Africa in the midst of the slave trades.

7：Many New World crops were introduced into Africa following Columbus's discovery of the Americas, but only maize (Zea mays) satisfies these three conditions. Maize first arrived on the African coast during the seventeenth century. It was initially introduced by the Portuguese to supply their trading forts, but the crop was quickly adopted by African farmers due to its high energy yield, its low labor requirements, and its short growing season. Cultivation spread quickly; as we discuss below, the available historical evidence indicates that maize was grown across much of the African continent by the early 1700s. Given its characteristics and the timing of its introduction, maize is the most likely cause of any agricultural productivity shock. Hence, we focus our attention on maize.

8：While maize is the most likely source of an agricultural productivity shock, we do not observe the specific dates it was adopted due to the incomplete historical record. To address this challenge we exploit cross-country differences in geographic characteristics and the timing of the crop's introduction into Africa to identify the effects of maize.4 Our approach relies on the fact that while maize diffused rapidly across the African continent after its introduction in the mid-seventeenth century, it could not be grown everywhere due to differences in time invariant geo-climatic conditions. This means that only the subset of countries that were suitable for the cultivation of maize could have been affected (or “treated”) by the crop when it was introduced into Africa. Hence, testing the Crosby-Curtin Hypothesis amounts to identifying the effects of maize on this group of countries. To do so, we adopt a variant of a simple difference-in-difference research design that compares outcomes from countries with large amounts of maize-suitable land to outcomes from countries with small amounts of maize-suitable land, before and after maize was introduced into Africa. This approach allows us to control for time-invariant country characteristics, such as geography, as well as continent-wide trends such as ongoing technological change and changes in the global demand for slaves, that would otherwise confound identification. We implement this design using a country-level panel data set that contains information on population levels between 1000 and 1900, slave exports between 1400 and 1800, the suitability of maize as a crop, and several other country characteristics.}} </s>"

The identification strategy used in this paper is a difference-in-differences (DD) method, controlling for key determinants in the selection of PMC counties. The sample is restricted to PMC counties and a placebo test is conducted by randomly assigning the adoption of PMC reforms to counties. An event study is also used to estimate year-wise changes in economic performance before and after the PMC reform.
The core story of this paper is to examine the impact of flattening government hierarchies on economic performance in China. The study focuses on the PMC reform, which aims to relieve financial strain on county-level governments, improve administrative efficiency, and stimulate local economic growth. The analysis finds that the adoption of PMC reforms reduces a county's GDP per capita and does not significantly improve social welfare.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {4：Our analysis proceeds in three stages. We first investigate the link between the PMC reform and a county's economic performance. Specifically, do PMC counties experience higher or lower per capita GDP over time? Then, to support a causal interpretation of our findings, we shed light on the channels through which the PMC system might influence economic performance. Specifically, what is the nature of the reform—does it involve simply the removal of one layer in the fiscal hierarchy, with authority moved from prefectures to provinces, or does it also involve subtle changes in revenue and expenditure assignment among various layers of government? If the former, does the flattening on average improve a county's fiscal revenue and inter-governmental transfers—the goals of the reform? How does increased span of control impact the upper-level government's ability to coordinate and monitor spending and land sales? Third, we examine how the PMC reform affects other economic outcomes, such as household income, consumption, and inequality.

5：The analysis involves constructing a novel data set from a large number of official sources. The data cover 1809 counties between 1995 and 2012. They contain very detailed information not only about GDP, fiscal revenue, transfers and expenditure, but also about changes in government organization. For each county, we measure the change in organizational structure with: (1) a PMC reform indicator, and (2) the span of control of the county government's supervising body. Such comprehensive panel data allow for an examination of China's county economies before and after the PMC reform, and the mechanism underlying such impacts.

6：The key challenge in identifying the effect of PMC reforms is selecting appropriate control groups for the treatment group. The validity of the difference-in-differences (DD) methods applied and the causal interpretation of the results rely on the assumption that non-PMC counties and counties that adopted PMC later are valid counterfactuals for what would have happened to earlier adopters in the absence of the PMC reform. However, the reformed counties are not randomly selected. To address the identification challenge, we control for the differences in the trends in outcomes between PMC counties and non-PMC counties depending on the key determinants in the selection of PMC counties, a strategy used by Gentzkow (2006). Beyond that, we restrict the sample to PMC counties, increasing confidence in the comparability of the treated and control groups. We also conduct a placebo test by randomly assigning the adoption of PMC reforms to counties. Finally, we use an event study to estimate year-wise changes in economic performance before and after the PMC reform with a window of eight years.}} </s>"

The paper uses a quasi-random assignment of areas close to historical transportation networks in China to examine the causal effect of access to transportation infrastructure on economic performance.
The paper investigates the impact of access to transportation infrastructure on economic outcomes in different regions in China during a period of rapid growth. It examines whether better access to transportation enriches or impoverishes regions and whether areas with better access serve as engines of growth when new economic opportunities arise.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {3：This paper makes progress in understanding the impact of access to transportation infrastructure by examining the causal effect of access on economic performance in different regions in China during a twenty-year period of rapid growth. We ask the straightforward question: do areas that are “quasi-randomly” assigned to have better access to transportation networks consequently have better economic outcomes in the long run? Specifically, we attempt to empirically examine two closely related questions. First, we ask whether access to better transportation enriches the average region that is affected (because it draws in or generates more new economic activities) or impoverishes it (because it becomes easier for human and physical capital to exit). Second, we ask whether areas that have better access to transportation networks benefit much more and serve as engines of growth when new economic opportunities arise and growth becomes possible after 1979. //提出问题

4：For our discussion, it is important to keep three points in mind. First, our focus is on long term effects. We are not only interested in the impact on trade and prices that result from greater access, which tend to be relatively quick, but also in the subsequent changes in the patterns of localization of economic activity as people and factories relocate. Second, the emphasis on understanding the effect of infrastructure for the average location is crucial to our study since it is entirely possible that some of the largest cities benefit from infrastructure through greater concentration of resources while most other places lose out. Finally, there cannot be one definitive answer to these questions, since the answer will clearly depend on the starting point – i.e., the first road to connect the agricultural hinterland to a port is very different from the fifth such road. //

5：We use county-level economic data from China to try to answer these questions. In many ways, China offers an ideal setting for our work. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Chinese government and a set of Western colonial powers built railroads connecting the historical cities of China to each other and to the newly constructed “Treaty Ports”.2 We identify our average “treated” areas to be those that were close to the straight line connecting this set of cities. Our analysis excludes the terminal cities, where there are obviously confounding effects. Our strategy is to first compare areas closer to the lines to areas further away and show that they have on average better infrastructure. We then compare various measures of economic outcomes further and closer to the line and interpret any difference in economic outcomes as the overall effect of any transportation infrastructure – the original railroads and any other infrastructure later added – along these historical transportation corridors.

6：This strategy has a number of advantages. First, it provides us with an exogenous source of variation in access to transportation networks. Second, this variation goes back to at least fifty years before our study begins in 1986, by which time the patterns of economic activity would have had ample chance to relocate. We can therefore ask what the long run level effect of being close to the line (and hence to transportation) was, say around 1986. Third, our study period, 1986–2006, coincides with China's opening up and subsequent growth acceleration. Our treatment areas were plausibly in a good position to take the lead in exploiting these new opportunities, exporting to the rest of the world, using their access, although they could also export their resources to the terminal cities, which would have the opposite effect. We therefore also study growth effects of being close to the line over the period 1986–2003.

9：However, there is an alternative and complementary interpretation under which the measured benefits of infrastructure are small even if better transportation causes substantial gains to overall GDP. The basic idea emphasizes the role of factor mobility. Under full labor and capital mobility, wages and incomes would be equalized in our treatment and control areas even if there are large macro effects and we would see no difference in their outcomes. Of course, the assumption of full factor mobility is clearly inconsistent with the institutional conditions in China. In the paper, we present a simple model which shows that we can observe similar patterns with limited factor mobility. Specifically, if labor mobility is very limited, but capital is also relatively immobile compared to goods, and its mobility depends on the distance to transportation infrastructure, more remote areas may actually retain more of their capital compared to better connected areas (where all the resources move to the nearest metropolitan center). For the latter reason, GDP per capita may not dramatically decline in remote areas. Moreover, this effect only tells us about the level of GDP. As far growth is concerned, since even the more remote locations retain a substantial part of their resources, they also retain the possibility of participating in and benefitting from the exposure to global markets that raised the growth rate everywhere in China. Therefore, the impact on the growth rate, starting at a lower level, can be similar in remote and less remote areas. We summarize this intuition in the body of the paper and provide a formal discussion in the Appendix.}} </s>"

The paper uses six different measures of intergenerational mobility in education to address methodological challenges and evaluate mobility in different ways.
The paper finds that intergenerational mobility in education is lower in developing countries compared to high-income countries. There is a convergence in mobility when using measures sensitive to changes in education inequality, but a divergence when using measures invariant to changes in inequality. There is a monotonically increasing relationship between mobility and national income for inequality-sensitive measures, while inequality-invariant measures show a U-shape pattern. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest mobility despite low levels of parental education. The world as a whole is less mobile than the average country in it, with a modest upward trend in global mobility. Girls are catching up to boys in intergenerational mobility in developing countries.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {Our Global Database on Intergenerational Mobility (GDIM) significantly expands the evidence base on intergenerational mobility in education – and makes it possible, for the first time, to paint a truly global picture of intergenerational mobility.1 This in turn allows us to test whether insights from the existing literature, which has mostly focused on developed countries, generalize to developing countries. We focus on mobility in education for two reasons.2 First, intergenerational data on education is more widely available than on income. Second, unlike income, the level of education does not change once acquired, meaning that it is unlikely to introduce a lifecycle bias when elicited at a point in time (Nybom and Jan, 2016). A limitation of focusing on education mobility is that it does not capture distortions in the labor market, such as the extent to which access to good jobs is contingent on the parental background one is born into.

Measuring intergenerational mobility in education is subject to several methodological challenges, namely that educational outcomes are bounded below, bounded above, and exhibit bunching. Six different measures of intergenerational mobility are considered that address these challenges in different ways. Specifically, we evaluate: for respondents born to parents in the bottom half of the education distribution, (1) the probability that respondents reach the top quartile and (2) the expected educational rank within their generation (see e.g., Asher et al., 2019), (3) the share of respondents with a completed primary education conditional on neither parent having completed primary education (see e.g., Alesina et al., 2021), (4) 1 minus the correlation coefficient between respondents' and parents’ years of schooling as well as (5) 1 minus the corresponding regression coefficient (see e.g., Hertz et al., 2007; Neidh?fer et al., 2018), and (6) the share of respondents that managed to surpass their parents in terms of education.3}} </s>"

Following the literature, I estimate the elasticity of substitution between migrants and natives using variation in the migrant–native ratios of wages and labor supplies across metro areas and years (Ottaviano and Peri, 2012, Manacorda et al., 2012, Card, 2009). Intuitively, a low sensitivity of the migrant–native wage ratio to an increase in migrant labor supply within an education group implies a high migrant–native substitutability. This requires the identification assumption that migrant locational sorting into metro areas is uncorrelated with the potential migrant–native wage ratio, distinct from the traditional assumption that locational sorting is uncorrelated with potential wages. To account for the possibility that this assumption is violated, I use an instrumental variable strategy based on the historical settlement patterns of Venezuelans (Altonji and Card, 1991, Card, 2001), and the similarity of OLS and 2SLS coefficients indicates that there is little migrant locational sorting according to this wage ratio. I also use internal migration data to confirm that results are not biased by native spatial arbitrage (Borjas, 2003, Borjas and Katz, 2007, Monras, 2020).}} </s>"

The paper examines the effect of exposure to TV during the electoral crisis in Kenya in 2017 on voters' behavior. It finds that TV had a significant impact on voter turnout in the repeat election, with a positive effect on supporters of the incumbent President and a negative effect on supporters of the opposition. TV exposure had no significant effect on involvement in electoral protests.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {To analyze the impact of TV on voters, I use a novel dataset on the staggered introduction of digital television in Kenya between 2013 and 2018. According to the Communication Authority of Kenya, more than 2,500 sublocations benefited from the migration from analog to digital television: this corresponds to approximately 7,000 polling stations that benefited from the expansion of the signal over the period. One challenge involved in estimating the causal impact of TV on mobilization comes from the risk of endogeneity due to plausible non-randomness in signal expansion. TV transmitters could have been installed in strategic locations – to maximize the number of receivers for instance –, and the voters with access to the signal might show specific political attitudes.

To overcome this risk of bias, I first investigate the parameters that explain whether a polling center is covered by the signal in 2017, and exhibit exogenous variation in the likelihood of receiving the signal. I construct a geo-coded dataset of Kenyan polling centers and TV transmitters and compute the fourth polynomial of the distance between each voting center and the nearest transmitter. The dataset also includes terrain ruggedness measures, distances to the capital or urban centers, urbanization status as well as demographic and economic covariates, measured at a fine-grained level. In line with the existing literature (Olken, 2009, Yanagizawa-Drott, 2014, Miner, 2015), I find that the distance to the transmitter and terrain features are the main predictors of signal reception. To capture the causal effect of exposure to TV, I rely on the identification assumption that locations with or without access to TV in 2017 are similar in unobserved characteristics, conditional on observables. I run a series of placebo tests to ascertain exogeneity in signal reception controlling for the determinants of signal propagation. I find that conditional on signal predictors, political preferences before 2013, and ethnic belongings, are not significantly correlated with TV reception in 2017. I run similar checks on economic and social covariates – before and at the time of the election – and do not find evidence of bias in the allocation of TV, conditional on the propagation determinants.

Then, I focus on two outcomes of interest as illustrative of the possible reactions to the institutional crisis: voters may decide to exit and not turn out or show their loyalty to their leader, or chose to voice their discontent by taking to the streets. I estimate the impact of access to TV on turnout for both the first and the recall election, and on occurrence of protests between the two elections, where the treated polling centers are those with access to the signal between 2013 and 2017, controlling for the signal predictors previously identified. Turnout dropped from 79% to 41% between the two elections because of the decrease in the remobilization rate among the opposition’s supporters but possibly also because of the lack of information provided to the voters about the new election taking place.}} </s>"

First, it extends the limited causal evidence on the impact of general versus vocational education in developing countries. Therefore, this is the first study to apply an RDD based on test scores to account for the nonrandom selection of students into tracks. We exploit a cutoff in the scores of an end-of-preparatory-school (9th grade) exam that tracks students in upper-secondary vocational or general education in Egypt. In this exam, students must score at least 70 points to be eligible for general upper-secondary education (Assaad, 2010, Assaad and Krafft, 2015a). We address selection into either the vocational or general education track based on the assumption that the exam scores cannot be manipulated. Therefore, we assume that the units just below and above the cutoff are comparable. To account for non-compliance in the assignment to upper-secondary general education, we employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (FRDD). Second, no other experimental or quasi-experimental study analyzes the impact of general versus vocational education in Egypt.5 Third, we estimate the long-term impacts of general versus vocational education approximately 17 years after program exit. In addition to our study, only Dai and Martins (2020) analyze the long-term effects of vocational versus general education in developing countries.6 Fourth, besides investigating the effect of general versus vocational education on labor market integration in terms of employment probability, we also evaluate its impact on three measures of employment quality: wages for those in wage employment, the probability of public-sector employment, and formal employment in the private sector. Analyzing employment quality is particularly important in developing countries, where under-employment and working conditions are often more critical than unemployment (Fields, 2004). Using data from two waves of the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS) for 2012 (OAMDI, 2019) and 2018 (OAMDI, 2020), we restrict our estimation sample to all men aged 25–49 who have taken the end-of-preparatory-school exam, passed it with scores ranging from 50 to 100, and continued on to complete upper-secondary education. Our sample also includes men who completed post-secondary or tertiary education (general or vocational), which represents one mechanism by which general upper-secondary education can affect labor market outcomes. While we acknowledge the important role of women in the Egyptian labor market, we exclude them from our analysis as female labor force participation in Egypt is low and there is selection into the labor market based on religious and cultural norms (Krafft, 2018, Hendy, 2015).}} </s>"

We study investment in learning among smallholder farmers by eliciting and analyzing their willingness-to-pay for a soil test in a modified public goods game across villages with varying soil heterogeneity. In our experiment, farmers are allowed to cooperate or to free ride on each others’ investments. We use collective contributions towards a soil test in the village as a provision mechanism. The soil test, partially performed in the field, provides information about chemical properties of the soil, and offers management recommendations to address limiting nutrient deficiencies, i.e., actionable information to raise agricultural yields and revenues (Corral et al., 2020, Harou et al., 2022, Tamim et al., 2022). Depending on the extent of spatial variation in soil characteristics, there may be positive externalities within the village to the provision of a single soil test, i.e, the test may be valuable not just to the owner of the plot whose soil is tested. Our sample consists of 600 farmers in 30 villages. We provided each farmer with 2000 Malawian Kwacha (MK) (about 3 $US at the time of the experiment) and conducted a total of four rounds of the public goods game in each village. In each of the first three rounds, we selected a different plot randomly chosen from the set of the plots constituted by the participant farmers. Both the cost of the soil test (7000 MK or about 10 $US) and the location of the plot selected for a soil test in each round were known by the farmers. Contributions, however, were recorded in private. In addition, we recorded the farmers’ perception of the similarity of their plot with the plot selected for testing, and other measures of soil similarity. Only one of the four rounds was randomly selected for implementation and testing, conditional on the total village contributions in that round exceeding the soil test cost. At the end of the experiment, we performed a soil analysis on the selected plot (and later on, for four more plots in the village).

We, like the farmers, distinguish between two dimensions of soil characteristics. The first dimension we call the soil type. Soil type captures observable physical characteristics of the soils including texture and color. For example, a sandy, white soil is a soil type, as is a loamy, dark soil. These characteristics are closely connected to the soil nomenclature soil scientists use, and are what we refer to in this paper when we talk about soil heterogeneity. As we will detail in the next section, our sample includes a considerable amount of soil heterogeneity, with three soil types in each village, on average. Within villages, we treat farmers who identified sharing the same soil type as members of what we call the same soil-type group. The second dimension of soil characteristics is based on the soil’s unobservable chemical properties, and represents the information provided by the soil test.}} </s>"

The identification strategy used in this paper is based on analyzing the impact of uninsured health shocks and cash constraints on farmers' decision to sell their milk to a cooperative. The study uses a linear specification with household and center-month fixed effects, as well as a semiparametric approach to account for non-linearities and threshold effects.
The core story of this paper is to investigate how interlinking agricultural and financial contracts can enhance the sustainability of farmer cooperatives in contexts of savings constraints and incomplete financial markets. The paper explores the use of agricultural cooperatives as a savings device for farmers, as well as the potential impact of health shocks and cash constraints on farmers' decision to side-sell their produce instead of selling it to the cooperative.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {In this paper, we analyze how uninsured health shocks and cash constraints influence farmers’ decision to sell to their cooperative, and whether the provision of insurance can limit side-selling. Focusing on two dairy cooperatives in Kenya, we study to what extent unexpected cash needs and fluctuating levels of cash on hand result in variation in daily milk deliveries. By paying once a month, the cooperatives defer farmers’ milk payment with an average of 25 days. As a return on this delay in payment, cooperatives may offer higher milk prices than the spot market; the monthly cooperative price in our primary study area is on average an estimated 19 to 35 percent higher than milk prices in local markets.2 We hence model the decision to sell milk to the cooperative as a savings device that yields a higher return compared with buffer stock assets such as cash, jewelry or small livestock, but at the cost of lower flexibility. Within the context of this model, health emergencies will affect the share of milk sales to the cooperative, unless farmers are protected by health insurance. More generally, in the absence of well-functioning financial markets, sales to the cooperative might decrease when cash on hand is low.

Our analysis is based on two datasets from two different Kenyan dairy farmer populations. The first is a four-wave panel dataset collected among 363 farmers, for which we also have administrative records of daily milk deliveries. Here, we find that households deliver less milk to the cooperative after having experienced health shocks. The second is a rich high-frequency diaries dataset of health events, detailed financial transactions, milk production and consumption, collected from a sample of members from another cooperative on a weekly basis over the course of a full year. The high-frequency dataset also allows us to investigate how side-selling is affected by fluctuating liquidity more generally. To proxy for cash on hand, we measure cash flows from non-dairy income in the last week and from milk production in the last month.

Using a linear specification with household and center-month fixed effects, we first investigate whether (health) shocks and their lags predict the share of milk sales to the cooperative, and whether monthly insurance coverage (which varies over time within households) reduces this effect of shocks on where the milk is sold. We conduct a variety of robustness test to examine the exogeneity of health shocks and health insurance status. We then investigate how cooperative sales are related to fluctuating levels of cash on hand, estimated from the weekly diaries data. Finally, to account for the non-linearities and threshold effects as implied by our model, we further examine the effect of cash constraints using a semiparametric approach, in which cash on hand enters nonparametrically, while including a parametric component to control for household fixed effects, other potential confounds, as well as health shocks and health insurance coverage. We also test for heterogeneity by the gender of the dairy farmer (to account for a gender bias in control over cooperative payments), the timing of milk production within the month (to differentiate between shorter and longer waiting periods until payment day) and the wet versus dry season (affecting general levels of milk production, income and liquidity).}} </s>"

The study uses an online survey with a treatment group receiving tips on fraud prevention and an incentivized condition to test the effect of education on scam identification ability.
The paper examines the effectiveness of educational campaigns in improving individuals' ability to detect scams and their confidence in this ability. It focuses on phone scams in Kenya and finds that while tips make individuals more cautious, they do not significantly increase scam identification ability. The study also highlights the importance of specific and targeted communication to improve scam identification.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {In this paper, we study susceptibility to scams and the effectiveness of a light-touch scam education in Kenya. First, we develop a novel measure for an individual’s scam identification ability (SIA) and confidence in their ability. For this, we collect actual scams and official communication that circulate in Kenya. Second, we test experimentally if common tips for scam detection improve SIA and confidence. We focus on Kenya, Africa’s leader in digital infrastructure and mobile money use (Koyama et al., 2021). At the same time, the country suffers from increasing rates of phone scams, which by now represent the most often cited consumer protection issue (Blackmon et al., 2021).

In an online survey (N  1000) we show respondents 12 different messages and ask them to indicate whether these messages are scam or not. Each classification decision is followed by a confidence rating. The messages include both common scams and genuine messages sent by, e.g., banks or telecommunication companies in Kenya. After having classified the first six messages, a random half of the respondents receive tips on fraud prevention that are commonly provided by banks or telecommunication companies. These tips warn consumers about “scam markers”, which include (i) typos and grammar mistakes, (ii) an unknown sender, (iii) a shortened link, and (iv) requests for private information such as pin codes or passwords. Ideally, these tips help respondents become better at distinguishing scams from genuine messages. However, it is also possible that tips about scams make respondents more cautious and hence more likely to classify any given message as scam. The latter would make it harder for service providers to communicate with their clients.}} </s>"

The identification strategy used in this paper is based on the measure of exposure to robots in local labor markets. The authors construct this measure using data on the increase in robot usage across industries and their baseline employment shares. They exploit adoption trends in European economies to focus on the component of investment in robots driven by technological advances. The assumption is that commuting zones with greater advances in robotics technology are not differentially affected by other labor market shocks or trends.
The core story of this paper is to estimate the equilibrium impact of industrial robots on local US labor markets. The authors find a negative relationship between a commuting zone's exposure to robots and its post-1990 labor market outcomes. The increase in the stock of robots between 1993 and 2007 reduced the average employment-to-population ratio in a commuting zone by 0.39 percentage points and average wages by 0.77%. The paper also explores the differential effects of robots on workers in different industries, occupations, and skill groups.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {In this paper, we estimate the equilibrium impact of a leading automation technology—industrial robots—on local US labor markets. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) defines an industrial robot as “an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, and multipurpose [machine]” (IFR 2014). That is, industrial robots are fully autonomous machines that do not need a human operator and can be programmed to perform several manual tasks, such as welding, painting, assembly, handling materials, and packaging. Textile looms, elevators, cranes, or transportation bands are not robots since they have a unique purpose, cannot be reprogrammed to perform other tasks, and/or require a human operator. This definition excludes other types of equipment and enables an internationally and temporally comparable measurement of a class of technologies—industrial robots—that are capable of replacing human labor in a range of tasks.
Our empirical approach is based on a model where robots and workers compete in the production of different tasks. Our model builds on Zeira (1998), Acemoglu and Autor (2011), and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018c) butextendstheseframeworkssothattheshareoftasksperformedbyrobots varies across sectors and there is trade between labor markets specializing in different industries. Improvements in robotics technology negatively affect wages and employment owing to a displacement effect (as robots directly displace workers from tasks that they were previously performing), but there is also a positive productivity effect (as other industries and/or tasks increase their demand for labor). Our framework clarifies that, because of the displacement effect, robots can have very different implications for labor demand than capital deepening or factor-augmenting technologies. Our model also shows that the effects of robotics technologies on employment and wages canbeestimatedbyregressingthechangeinthesevariablesonexposure to robots. Exposure to robots is a Bartik-style measure (Bartik 1991), constructed from the interaction between baseline industry shares in a local labor market and technological possibilities for the introduction of robots across industries.
After presenting industry-level correlations, we investigate the equilibrium impact of robots in local labor markets, proxied by commuting zones in the United States.2 We construct our measure of exposure to robots using data from the IFR on the increase in robot usage across 19 industries (roughly at the two-digit level outside manufacturing and at the three-digit level within manufacturing) and their baseline employment shares from the census before the onset of recent advances in robotics technology. To focus on the component of investment in robots driven by technological advances, we exploit adoption trends in European economies that are ahead of the United States in robotics. Our identifying assumption is that commuting zones housing industries with greater advances in robotics technology are not differentially affected by other labor market shocks or trends—a presumption that we investigate from a number of angles}} </s>"

The core story of the paper is to examine how broadband internet affects labor market outcomes and productivity of different types of workers. The study finds evidence of skill complementarity of broadband internet, with wages and employment of skilled individuals increasing with broadband availability. The adoption of broadband internet in firms is also associated with a substantial increase in the output elasticity of skilled labor.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {In this article, we examine how broadband internet affects the labor market outcomes and productivity of different types of workers. Our context is the adoption of broadband internet in Norwegian firms over the period 2001–2007. Norway is a small open economy with segmented local labor markets. Our analysis employs several data sources that we can link through unique firm and individual identifiers. This gives us information over time and across areas on individuals’ wages and employment status as well as on firms’ use of input factors, adoption of broadband internet, and output. 
As a source of exogenous variation in broadband availability, we follow Bhuller et al. (2013) in exploiting a public program aimed at ensuring broadband access at a reasonable price to all households throughout the country. Because of limited funding, access to broadband was progressively rolled out, so that the necessary infrastructure (access points) was established in different municipalities at different times. Conditional on year and municipality fixed effects, we argue the spatial and temporal variation in the availability of broadband across municipalities is plausibly exogenous. Our identification strategy is motivated by two features of the broadband program. First, most of the supply and demand factors tend to vary little over time. Second, the timing of the roll-out across areas is unlikely to co-vary with the key correlates of productivity and worker outcomes. We demonstrate that the data are consistent with these program features, and further challenge our identification strategy in a number of ways, finding little cause for worry.}} </s>"

Specifically, I focus on a period during which South Africa was experiencing corruption scandals and socio-economic turmoil, and look at the impact of 3G coverage on voter turnout, number of parties, and the allocation of vote shares among the major parties
Over the last 20 years, South Africa has experienced a substantial technological and political transformation. While Internet connectivity drastically improved, the incumbent party – the African National Congress – loss voters’ support, and both political participation and competition grew. However, identifying the causal impact of mobile Internet access on political outcomes is challenging. Compared to the literature on radio and TV coverage,2 in this case it is harder to exploit technological features of the transmitters to find an exogenous source of variation. Internet coverage is far from random, as it reflects private operators’ decisions on where to install the technology (Buys et al., 2009). In this paper, I rely on a granular measure of mobile Internet coverage (1 km by 1 km on the ground) from the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), and combine it with rich administrative electoral data. In particular, I assemble a new dataset containing geo-referenced information at the voting (sub)district-year-level on the share of area covered by 3G, political outcomes, protests, population density, luminosity as a proxy for GDP, and a variety of socio-demographic characteristics, infrastructure and geography.
To address endogeneity concerns and uncover causal relationships, I adopt two complementary strategies: a Difference-in-Differences estimator and an Instrumental Variable approach. In the first case, I exploit variation over time and space in the expansion of the 3G technology along with the change in political outcomes across approximately 35,000 partitions of voting districts between the 2006 and 2016 municipal elections.

The identification strategy of the paper is to exploit the introduction of composite racquets in men's professional tennis during the late 1970s and early 1980s to study the effects of skill-altering technological change on workers.
The core story of the paper is that skill-altering technological change can disrupt the labor market by changing the relative values of skills, which can negatively impact older workers and better workers. The paper examines the effects of the introduction of composite racquets in men's professional tennis on player performance, age distribution, intergenerational inequality, and exit rates.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {We develop a theory, inspired by MacDonald and Weisbach (2004), of this phenomenon, which we call skill-altering technical change. Our theory emphasizes that workers endogenously invest in a portfolio of skills over their life cycle. We show that new technologies that change the relative values of skills can hurt older workers, who have spent a lifetime investing in the old, ideal skill mix, and better workers, who, by definition, possess more of the skills that were previously more valuable. We find that, depending on the elasticity of demand for workers’ output, the effect of a new technology can either increase or decrease exit rates and cross-sectional inequality. Moreover, the specter of future, skill-altering change makes current human capital investment risky, especially investment in specialized skills.

To test our model’s predictions empirically and quantify the effects of skill-altering technical change, we exploit the introduction of composite racquets in men’s professional tennis during the late 1970s and early 1980s. These new racquets drastically changed the way the game was played, increasing the importance of hitting with spin and power relative to control. There are four reasons this episode in men’s professional tennis is a useful setting to study the effects of skill-altering technological change on workers. First, we have detailed panel data on multiple cohorts of individual workers (players), allowing us to track the impacts of skill-altering change over multiple generations of workers. Such data is difficult to obtain in most settings. Second, the new technology arrived suddenly and unexpectedly and was adopted universally within a few years. This is valuable because the timing of the innovation is obvious, the speed of the transition reduces the concern that other economic shocks are driving the results, and this particular innovation was specific to tennis, thereby minimizing concerns about general equilibrium effects. Third, tennis careers are short—six years on average and rarely more than fifteen years—which allows us to follow multiple cohorts of players over their entire careers. Another advantage of short careers is that it further reduces the concern that other economic shocks are driving the results. Fourth, since we can observe the performance of a player without worrying about the effects of teammates, professional tennis offers unusually clean measures of worker productivity.}} </s>"

The paper uses a combination of a survey module and an information experiment to examine workers' beliefs about the part-time pay gap and their causal inferences.
The paper investigates whether workers form expectations about the consequences of working part-time based on misguided causal inference. It explores the presence of causal misperceptions and selection neglect in relation to the part-time pay gap.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {To examine if workers wrongly draw causal conclusions from average full-time/part-time pay gaps, we ask three research questions. First, do workers believe full-time and part-time workers earn different hourly wage rates? Second, what is the perceived causal effect of switching between full-time and part-time employment for a given worker? Third, how do perceived causal effects relate to perceived raw gaps in pay between full-time and part-time workers, and do beliefs reflect selection neglect?

To answer these questions, we implement a survey module combined with an information experiment in the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS) between 2016 and 2019. The SOEP-IS is an annual panel survey representative of German households with high quality data collection and face-to-face interviewing.

In the non-experimental part of the survey, we elicit workers’ beliefs about the mean hourly wage rate earned by full-time workers in their occupation, as well as the mean hourly wage rate earned by part-time workers in their occupation. We use these measures to quantify respondents’ beliefs about the perceived difference in hourly pay between full-time and part-time workers. Furthermore, we measure workers’ beliefs about the causal part-time wage penalty. We define the causal part-time penalty as the change in hourly pay that a given worker experiences when switching between full-time and part-time employment. Specifically, we ask respondents to consider a hypothetical scenario of switching between working 40 h per week and 20 h per week, ceteris paribus, and then provide an estimate of the expected change in hourly wage rates associated with this transition. Respondents provide three different estimates for this hypothetical scenario: i) the predicted wage change for an average full-time worker in their occupation switching to a part-time position, ii) the predicted wage change for an average part-time worker in their occupation switching to full-time, and iii) respondents’ self-expected wage change when switching between full- and part-time employment, which depends on the current employment status of the respondent (full- or part-time). The non-experimental survey data allow us to quantify the perceived raw difference in hourly pay between full-time and part-time workers, as well as the perceived causal effect of switching between full- and part-time work. To study selection neglect, we analyze descriptively whether workers distinguish between correlation and causation by examining whether they expect causal effects that are quantitatively similar to the raw wage gap they believe exists between full-time and part-time workers. To test for selection neglect more formally, we further design and implement an information experiment, described next.

The experiment allows us to causally estimate whether workers infer from average pay gaps about the causal part-time penalty. It consists of two treatment groups who receive different information, and one control group who receives no information. Participants are randomly allocated to one of the three groups with equal probability. The first treatment group receives information about the average gap in hourly pay between full-time workers and part-time workers in the German population. We elicit self-beliefs about the causal part-time penalty post treatment, using the same survey instrument as in the non-experimental questionnaire, and exploit the experimentally induced variation in beliefs between the first treatment group and the control group to analyze if individuals draw causal conclusions from correlational information.

We further use the experimental design to study the role of de-biasing and to test whether selection neglect persists when individuals are informed of the data generating process (DGP), as shown in some laboratory settings (Barron et al., 2019) but not others (López-Pérez et al., 2022). To this end, we provide the second treatment group with an alternative information treatment that also reports the average pay gap between full-time and part-time workers, but additionally educates subjects about the selection mechanism driving the observed wage gap. Specifically, the second information treatment points out that observed pay gaps between full-time and part-time workers can largely be explained by differences in work experience.

Finally, we analyze some behavioral implications of worker beliefs about part-time pay. Exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the SOEP-IS, we study descriptively how worker beliefs relate to planned and realized transitions between full-time and part-time employment.}} </s>"

This is understandable because in a world in which the assumptions of the neoclassical model do not hold, estimating the labor supply function is challenging. The estimation of the labor supply function based on the axiom of revealed preferences relies on data on actual working hours and wages and involves identification assumptions regarding, among other things, the number of job offers and the working hours stipulated in them (Bloemen, 2008, Pencavel, 2016). Other identification issues concern the functional form of the labor supply function and the set of covariates considered. These identification issues motivate the interest in stated preferences in the form of self-reported desired working hours as an alternative data source.3 Precisely such self-reported desired hours—together with actual hourly wages—are used to construct the counterfactual distribution in the present paper.4}} </s>"

The paper uses a quasi-experiment that exploits three sources of variation in the introduction of an emissions market for nitrogen oxides (NOx) to identify the effects of air pollution on defensive investments and health outcomes.
The paper examines the demand for air quality improvements and the associated defensive investments, such as medication usage, and their impact on health outcomes. It finds that reductions in air pollution led to a decline in medication expenditures and a decrease in summertime mortality rates.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {3. 
This paper develops a measure of WTP for air quality improvements that accounts for both the direct health impacts and defensive investments. As a measure of defensive behavior, we investigate whether medication usage responds to changes in air quality. This is likely to be an especially important measure of defensive expenditures, because, for example, the annual cost of prescription medications for asthma is reported to exceed the monetized value of any other component of asthma’s social cost, including mortality, emergency department admissions, or lost productivity (Weiss and Sullivan 2001). We also provide new evidence on how air pollution affects more commonly studied outcomes like mortality and hospitalizations.

The empirical application is based on a quasi-experiment that exploits three sources of variation in the introduction of an emissions market for nitrogen oxides (NOx). The NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) operated a cap-and-trade system for over 2,500 electricity generating units and industrial boilers in the eastern and midwestern United States between 2003 and 2008. Because this market had the goal of decreasing ozone pollution, which reaches high levels in summer, the market operated only between May 1 and September 30. Specifically, we use a triple-difference estimator that compares pollution, defensive expenditures, and health outcomes in the NBP participating and nonparticipating states, before versus after 2003, and summer versus winter.}} </s>"

The paper examines the effect of conflict on firms' economic performance in Libya. It explores the mechanisms through which conflict affects firms' activities, including the reduction in productivity of production inputs and the increase in firms' exit. The study finds that the negative effect of conflict on firms' output is non-linear, with the marginal effect becoming smaller for surviving firms as conflict intensity increases.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {Our analysis is guided by a simple theoretical framework to study the impact of conflict exposure on firms’ activities. Firms produce by combining domestic and foreign inputs, and high-productivity firms are more intensive in foreign inputs. Conflict exposure for the firm enters the production function as a reduction in the productivity (availability) of these inputs. However, depending on the nature of the conflict, the latter affects inputs’ productivity differently. We show that an increase in conflict intensity decreases output, induces factors’ substitution, and increases firms’ exit. These effects are heterogeneous across firms depending on the intensity of the impact of conflict on different inputs and the input mix adopted by the firm. Two are the novel implications of our theoretical framework. First, the relationship between a firm’s productivity and resilience to conflict depends on the type of conflict. In particular, there is a negative (positive) relationship – i.e., low productivity firms suffer a smaller (larger) output drop – if conflict events affect relatively more (less) foreign inputs. Second, the negative effect of conflict on a firm’s output is non-linear. As conflict intensity increases, its marginal effect becomes smaller for surviving firms.}} </s>"

It finds that air pollution increases the likelihood and numbers of social conflicts, with larger effects when endogeneity is accounted for.

First, we rely on the panel structure of the data and utilize a high-dimensional fixed effect technique to estimate the causal relations, controlling for a series of meteorological factors in flexible forms and a rich set of fixed effects to capture time-invariance and time-varying confounding factors. Conditional on such confounding factors, the variations used for identification in the fixed effect model come from different levels of exposure to air pollution across dates for individuals living in the same city. 

Second, leveraging the rich information from the daily dataset, we also construct effective instruments to address potential con founders that may covary with structural and seasonal-related phenomena. Specifically, we use the instrumental variable (IV) method, in which temperature inversion and wind patterns (i.e., wind direction and wind speed) are adopted as exogenous shocks to local air pollution concentrations. The latter one is used in the robustness checks. These instrumental variables are quite plausible and have precedent in the literature, for example, bolstering causal claims by instrumenting for pollution with plausibly exogenous variations in temperature inversion (Dechezlepr?etre et al., 2019; Klauber et al., 2020; Yi et al., 2020) and wind patterns (Bondy et al., 2020; Deryugina et al., 2019; Heyes and Zhu, 2019).

One potential concern in linking pollution exposure to social conflicts is the fact that the effect of air pollution on biological processes such as hormones can accumulate over time. The identification challenge here lies in the fact that the dates of social conflicts may not always coincide with the dates of corresponding air pollution in that city. We thus replicate our analysis from the daily level to a more aggregated time scale, i.e., the monthly level.}} </s>"

Using a large sample of firms from 34 countries, the paper finds that firms in countries with strong-FTR languages register fewer patents and receive fewer citations compared to firms in countries with weak-FTR languages.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {Because language structure is clearly out of a firm’s control, it is unlikely that the causation goes from innovation to language FTR. However, our findings are subject to omitted variable bias due to the correlation between language and country-level characteristics. We adopt several methods to control for omitted variable bias to identify the causal effect. First, we control for a variety of country characteristics ranging from formal institutions such as legal origin, religion and intellectual property protection to informal institutions such as various cultural attributes. Second, although we control for a battery of country-level characteristics, our results might still be biased due to other observable and unobservable country-level attributes. To further alleviate these concerns, we conduct within-country tests by studying a single country with a multilingual environment. The within-country tests avoid omitted country-level bias because all firms face the same country-level characteristics

To investigate the underlying economic mechanism of our findings, we collect information on CEO birthplace and inventor nationality in our sample. We distinguish whether the CEO (inventor) is from a strong-FTR-speaking country and rerun our regression. We find that firms with CEOs (inventors) from countries where strong-FTR languages are spoken are associated with lower innovation output, indicating that language FTR shapes perceptions and beliefs around future rewards from innovation. Another advantage of investigating inventor language is that we are able to directly control for country fixed effects to alleviate the concern of omitted variable bias.

Finally, we perform a variety of additional tests to ensure the robustness of the main results. First, we adopt four alternative measures to define language FTR. Specifically, we assign language into weak and strong-FTR groups using two stronger criteria (Inflectional FTR and Prediction FTR). In addition, we apply two continuous measures (Verb Ratio and Sentence Ratio) based on a word-frequency analysis of online weather forecasts. Second, we choose to use 2-year ahead and 3-year-ahead innovation outputs as alternative dependent variables because innovation represents a long term investment in intangible assets. We also adopt the log value of one plus citations per patent to proxy for the quality of innovation. Finally, our findings might be driven by specific countries.

The paper aims to address the limitations of previous macro-economic assessments by examining the impact of rainfall changes on economic production at a higher spatial resolution and a wider range of timescales. It argues that focusing on annual totals and monthly means may not capture the realistic future costs, and highlights the importance of considering higher-order moments of the distribution of daily rainfall.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {To address these issues, we assess higher-order moments of the annual distribution of daily rainfall in conjunction with subnational eco[1]nomic output. The distribution of daily rainfall is highly non-Gaussian (Fig.?1) and we therefore take a threshold approach.

Thresholds are set either as constants or as percentiles of the historical distribution (1979–2019) of local daily rainfall (Methods). The second approach allows us to implicitly account for local adaptation to prevailing rainfall conditions.

The paper examines the effect of eliminating policy-induced frictions between jurisdictions on local economic growth in China.

We use GDP and nighttime light intensity to measure aggregate outcomes. Nighttime light intensity, gathered from weather satellite recordings, has been increasingly used by economists to measure economic activity in developing countries, especially at the local level (Henderson et al., 2012, Hodler and Raschky, 2014, Storeygard, 2016). Because nighttime light intensity is not susceptible to political manipulations, it complements GDP as a measure of economic activity.

Two challenges need to be addressed to empirically test the effect of eliminating market frictions, as pointed out by Donaldson (2015). The first challenge is finding a suitable control group to address the endogeneity issue. Misallocations may not be the only difference between the treatment and the control group. The second challenge, as proposed by Rubin (1980), is that the control and treatment groups should not interact; otherwise, there may be over-estimation or under-estimation, depending on the direction of the spillover effect.

Firstly, we construct a list of counties chosen by prefecture-level cities to be incorporated but not approved by higher-level governments due to various political and geographical reasons. This allows us to compare the treatment group to an applied-but-failed group, which helps adjust for the nonrandom selection of counties by prefectures.

Secondly, we take advantage of the exogenous timing of the incorporation for those successfully incorporated counties. Specifically, we compare counties that experienced incorporation in year  to those that would experience incorporation at least  years later, for example, in year  and onwards. The two control groups partially solve the second identification problem, as the treatment and control counties are relatively isolated geographically.}} </s>"

Specifically, we disentangle the effects of two quasi-exogenous indicators of local exposure to new genetically engineered (GE) soy seeds and increased demand from China on deforestation and land use across Brazilian municipalities from 2000 to 2017. We measure local exposure to technological innovation by assessing the potential productivity gains resulting from adopting new GE soy seeds introduced in Brazil in 2003 (Bustos et al., 2016). We measure local exposure to increased export demand from China involves a two-step process (Costa et al., 2016). We first use international trade flow data to compute the differential growth in Chinese demand for each product compared to the rest of the world (excluding Brazil). Then, we allocate the China-product-specific demand growth to municipalities in Brazil based on their production composition in 1995.

Key to our identification, we show that there is variation in differential exposure to Chinese demand and productivity shocks across municipalities. This enables us to study their effects in a single equation, as in Autor et al. (2015). Our identifying assumption is that variation in suitability for GE soy seeds and exposure to China-induced export demand are uncorrelated with other factors influencing land use changes. Moreover, our method for measuring local exposure to increased Chinese demand relies on the assumption of shock exogeneity. Following Borusyak et al.

The authors provide evidence suggesting that the allocation of licenses was quasi-random, conditional on the data considered by the selection committee. They use matching methods to estimate the medium-term effects of obtaining a license on business and household outcomes.
The core story of the paper is to examine the indirect effects of a large-scale program of restricted cash transfers on local businesses in Kenya. The authors find that businesses that received a license to accept digital cash transfers experienced significant increases in revenue, profits, and productivity. They also find that the program created a two-tier market structure, with lower prices in the cash market and higher prices in the restricted market for digital cash transfers or vouchers.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {First, we build a theoretical model of the effects of a cash-based intervention on prices, business outcomes, and household welfare. The predicted impacts of transfers on households and businesses depend on the degree of competition but also on the characteristics of the cash-based intervention. The case of unrestricted cash transfers in a perfectly competitive market is simple: apart from a possible period of adjustment in the short run, businesses do not benefit from transfers as prices are equal to marginal costs. Benefits are entirely reaped by transfer recipients. Markets are however rarely perfect, especially in developing countries. Regulations and credit constraints often act as entry barriers in the formal sector. Prices are rarely indicated. Transportation costs can be very large, as roads are often non-existent or in poor conditions. The presence of fixed costs means that the assumption of non-increasing returns to scale is often inaccurate. We build a Salop circle model to study the effects of cash transfers in the presence of market imperfections. With entry barriers and transportation costs, we find that businesses indirectly benefit from cash transfers, even after the adjustment period in the short run.

We also extend the model to study the case of restricted cash transfers that can only be spent at a limited number of licensed shops. Restricted cash transfer programs are widespread, taking the form of digital cash transfers or vouchers (Siu et al., 2023). Girling and Urquhart (2021) estimate that, 29 percent of cash-based humanitarian assistance in 2020 – nearly 2 billion USD – was provided with restrictions on how and where the transfers can be spent. In the US, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is distributing electronic cash transfers restricted to food, reaching 40 million Americans in 2018 with total benefits amounting to 61 billion USD. Restricted cash transfers are also used to promote eco-friendly consumption, as seen in programs like the EcoCheque program in Belgium.4 With restricted transfers, we show that a two-tier market structure with two different sets of prices may emerge: low prices in the cash market, which is more competitive, and high prices in the new, restricted, market for digital cash transfers or vouchers.

Our empirical analysis assesses the business impacts of a large-scale program of restricted cash transfers implemented by the World Food Programme (WFP) in Kenya. In 2018, about 400,000 refugees living in camps or settlements in Kenya were receiving monthly digital transfers worth 3 to 13 dollars.5 These transfers were restricted to food items and can only be spent at licensed shops. To ensure only licensed vendors could sell to beneficiaries, WFP used a mobile money platform only accessible to that group of vendors. Licenses were allocated by WFP following a competitive process in two steps. First, applicants had to fill an application form, in which they had to describe the characteristics of their businesses and commit to certain standards of conduct. Second, a multi-stakeholder committee with representatives from humanitarian organizations and the Government of Kenya allocated the licenses based on the data in the application forms. They deliberately selected a diversity of shop owners in terms of gender, origin, and location of their shops.We assess the impact of being allocated a license on the business and household outcomes of applicants. First, we provide evidence suggesting that the allocation of licenses was quasi-random, conditional on the data considered by the selection committee. In particular, the unconfoundedness assumption is plausible in our study, because: (1) we have a detailed understanding of how the licensing process took place; (2) we have access to all the data available to the selection committee; (3) licensed and unlicensed businesses are operating in the same economic environment and have been administered the same surveys; (4) placebo tests confirm that treatment status is uncorrelated with pre-determined characteristics proxying for entrepreneurial ability; and (5) proxies for business size and capacity are insignificant when estimating the propensity score, showing that the selection committee did not systematically select the most (or least) successful businesses. As the unconfoundedness assumption is rhetorically and statistically plausible (McKenzie, 2021), experimental and matching methods should yield similar unbiased impact estimates (Heckman et al., 1997, Dehejia and Wahba, 2002, Diaz and Handa, 2006). We match successful and unsuccessful applicants using data from the application process, and estimate the medium-term effects of obtaining a license to accept the digital cash from the transfer on the revenue, profit, and productivity of businesses and on some aspects of their operations, including prices. In addition, we estimate medium-term effects on household consumption, asset ownership, and total household income of applicants.}} </s>"

The paper uses a combination of cross-sectional and time-series variation in violence to identify the causal effect of conflict on social capital. The cross-sectional variation is based on the suitability for growing coca in Colombian municipalities, while the time-series variation comes from external shocks to coca markets in Peru and Bolivia.
The paper examines the impact of violence on social capital in Colombia, a country with high levels of violence. It argues that the effect of violence on social capital depends on the ability to identify the enemy and the intensity of the violence. The results show that violence has a negative effect on social capital, but the effect is weaker when the perpetrators can be identified and for lower levels of violence.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {Specifically, I propose that the impact of violence on social capital depends on two factors: (i) the possibility of identifying the enemy, and (ii) the intensity of the violence. With regard to the former, the ability to distinguishing the enemy affects the certainty of whom people can trust. In municipalities in which violent attacks were perpetrated by difficult to discern militias, the effect is larger than when armed groups were clearly identifiable. Indeed, militias do not wear uniforms, bracelets with groups insignias, flags, or carry visible guns, and tend to mostly dress like the civilian population. As concerns the latter factor, very high levels of violence can be so disruptive that communities are unable to react, unlike for low levels of violence where the possibility of organizing to fight a common threat is greater. A failure to account for these two factors provides a tenable explanation for the mixed results found by different scholars.

Two main challenges arise in estimating the causal effect of conflict on social capital. On the one hand, social capital levels could affect the intensity of conflict, leading to reverse causality concerns. This is the case if well-organized communities protect themselves from violent attacks through neighborhood watch schemes (Kaplan et al., 2010), or if armed groups target communities with low social capital so as to more easily take control. On the other hand, the correlation between conflict and social capital may be driven by omitted variables (i.e. the large variation in institutional performance), which could have a confounding effect rather than reflecting a causal impact. In either case, the measures of conflict on social capital will likely be biased.

I overcome these issues by exploiting the combination of a cross-sectional variation in violence and a plausible exogenous time-series variation in violence. The first source of variation regards the suitability for growing coca in Colombian municipalities, an important dimension given that armed groups largely finance their fighting with coca production. The second refers to external shocks to coca markets in Peru and Bolivia. Together with Colombia, these two countries are the main coca leaf producers in the world (UNODC, 2009). Thus, the eradication of coca plants in neighboring countries affects the demand for coca in Colombia, and in turn the intensity of violence. Mejia and Restrepo (2015) argue that the presence of coca plantations leads to violence, as property rights must be protected from other armed groups, and because violence is required to control municipalities for the planting of coca.5 Since these shocks should affect coca-producing municipalities differently than non-producers, I use satellite data on ecological conditions to construct an exogenous index for coca cultivation at the municipal level. Using the interaction between cross-border shocks on coca markets and the coca index as an instrument has two main advantages: (i) it provides conditionally random variation in violence over time, and (ii) it allows for different trends of violence across municipalities.

The validity of the instrument hinges on one critical assumption: cross-border shocks to the coca market did not affect municipalities that were more suitable for coca production in other unobservable dimensions. I address this concern by showing that the results are robust to the inclusion of controls for employment, pupils registered at school, tax collection, forced displaced population, suitability for growing coffee, and the possible legacy of the biggest drug lord in Colombia, Pablo Escobar. In addition, I present several checks that suggest that coca production has an effect on social capital only through the channel of violence. To this end, I digitized historical records on community organizations, an assessment of which indicates that the suitability for growing coca only affects social capital when the conflict is financed by coca, and not for previous political conflicts.}} </s>"

The identification strategy used in the paper is based on exploiting exogenous variation in the local presence of peacekeepers. The road distance of DHS cluster's centroid to the closest UN base is used as a measure of individual exposure to peacebuilding activities.
The paper examines the effects of peacebuilding on fertility rates in Liberia, a country with a history of violent conflict and high fertility rates. The findings suggest that peacebuilding has a significant negative effect on fertility, with a decline in the likelihood of having a child and a decrease in the total number of children per woman. The study explores the mechanisms behind these findings, including increased contraceptive use, improved access to healthcare, and a shift towards a 'quality over quantity' approach to parenting.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {Against this backdrop of conflicting evidence, we explore the case of Liberia. With a history of violent conflict, and one of the world's highest fertility rates, averaging 4 children per woman compared to the global average of 2.5 (UN DESA, 2019), Liberia provides a crucial case for investigating the effects of peacebuilding on fertility rates. Between 2003 and 2018, the country hosted the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), one of the largest and most important peacekeeping missions since 1960. The main task of UNMIL was to support the implementation of a peace process in the immediate aftermath of the Second Liberian Civil War, with the arrival of peacekeepers marking the end of the conflict. However, simply reaching peace agreements and ending the conflict does not necessarily guarantee the cessation of violence or improve perceptions of security. Even if violence subsides, its psychological impact can linger on, and perceptions of insecurity may affect fertility. Focusing on the effect of peacekeeping operations in a post-conflict setting helps us examine the joint role of security and service provision in shaping fertility decisions.5 Indeed, while violence halted across the country, only some locations benefitted from the enhanced peace (security and services) provided by the UN intervention.

We integrate geocoded data on the local deployment of UNMIL with the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Liberia in 2007, 2013, and 2019. To identify the casual effect of peacebuilding on fertility, we exploit exogenous variation in the local presence of peacekeepers. We use the road distance of DHS cluster's centroid to the closest UN base, providing a granular measure of individual exposure to peacebuilding activities. Since the location of the women corresponds to the centroid of the cluster, more than one woman is usually assigned to the same centroid.}} </s>"

The identification strategy of the paper is to use wealth management products (WMPs) in China, which have a local market, to examine the effect of housing market performance on the expected returns offered by banks for their WMPs. The cross-location and over-time variations in both housing market performance and the expected returns on WMPs are used to identify the effect on the financing costs of financial institutions.
The core story of the paper is that housing booms can elevate the financing costs of financial institutions. Higher house price appreciation rates lead to increased investment in the housing market by households, reducing their investments in non-real estate assets and requiring higher returns on other investment opportunities. This increased demand for housing investments raises the financing costs for financial institutions.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the effect of house price growth on the financing costs of financial institutions. If real estate assets exhibit higher appreciation rates, households will expect greater future house price appreciation and thus invest more of their savings into the housing market and invest less in or require a higher return on other investment opportunities (e.g., deposits, bonds, and stocks), which will increase the financing costs of financial institutions and firms.1

One challenge to identify the effect of housing market performance on financing costs in the economy is that although housing markets are local, the markets of other investment tools are usually national: returns of bonds and stocks are determined by all investors throughout the country; deposit rates in China are strictly regulated by the central bank. Consequently, although there could be a spurious correlation between the national trend in housing markets and the returns of deposits, bonds, and stocks, it is far from sufficient to make a causal inference. It is possible that a third macroeconomic factor (e.g., monetary policy) affects both the national trend in housing markets and the returns of deposits, bonds, and stocks and therefore generates this spurious correlation.

In this paper, we employ wealth management products (WMPs), the largest component of China's shadow-banking sector, and examine how housing market performance affects the expected returns (promised yields at issuance) offered by banks for their WMPs. Unlike bonds and stocks, many WMPs have a local market, i.e., they are sold exclusively to a certain city or several cities. To be able to purchase WMPs issued in a certain city, households have to visit a local branch of a bank to open a local account. Accordingly, our identification strategy is that we employ the cross-location and over-time variations in both housing market performance and the expected returns offered by banks on their WMPs to identify the effect of housing market performance on the financing costs of financial institutions.
To summarize, there are two requirements in our identification strategy: first, the issuing market of the WMPs should be local; second, the market of the investment target for the money raised from the WMPs should be national. There are many financial products in which households invest their savings and through which financial institutions and nonfinancial firms raise funds, but only WMPs in China can simultaneously meet these two requirements for identification. The issuing markets of stocks and bonds are national. The deposit market and deposit rates in China are strictly regulated by the central bank. Although the deposit markets in the U.S. could be local because local banks can determine their interest rates of deposits with a certain degree of freedom,3 the deposits obtained locally are more likely to be invested in local businesses.

To examine the microeconomic mechanism through which housing market performance affects the financing costs of financial institutions, we further conduct household-level analyses by using data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) and provide evidence that house price growth can crowd out households' WMP investments. }} </s>"

The paper uses an annual panel of over 4000 rural households in northeast China from 2004-2014 and matches it with high-frequency weather data to identify the economic impacts of extreme heat on corn-growing households and their adaptive behaviors.
The paper examines how rural households in northeast China respond to extreme heat shocks and mitigate economic losses. It finds that extreme heat significantly reduces corn yields and leads to substantial economic losses, but impacted households successfully smooth their consumption through the use of financial assets and buffer stocks. The paper also highlights the lack of contemporaneous production adjustments and the forward-looking behavior of households in adjusting their crop mix towards heat-resistant crops.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {This paper conducts a detailed empirical investigation on how rural households respond to extreme heat shocks and how well they attenuate economic losses using various adaptive strategies. A key innovation of our work is to provide a comprehensive assessment on rural households’ adaptive behaviors by simultaneously examining their consumption and productive adjustments to the experience of extreme heat. The interconnection between production and consumption is particularly relevant in the developing country contexts given that a long literature has suggested the non-separability between production and consumption adjustments when market imperfections exist (De Janvry et al., 1991, Taylor and Adelman, 2003, LaFave and Thomas, 2016).
We match station-monitored high-frequency weather data with an annual panel of more than 4000 rural households over 2004–2014 in northeast China. Our panel data of rural households are based on a unique annual survey that records rich information on household-level characteristics, expenditures, food consumption, crop-specific productive behaviors, financial behaviors, and assets. Exploiting exogenous year-to-year variation in growing-season temperature, we identify the economic impacts of extreme heat on corn-growing households, their responses in consumption, and their adaptive behaviors in asset management and productive adjustments.

The paper uses several estimation strategies including instrumental variable (IV), difference-in-difference (DID), synthetic control, and panel fixed effects to overcome the challenge of endogeneity in estimating the economic impact of electricity outages.
The paper examines the impact of electricity outages on employment in Africa. It finds that outages have a negative effect on employment, with estimates suggesting a 4.7 to 13.5 percentage point increase in unemployment. The effects are concentrated in non-agricultural sectors and skilled jobs, with private-sector workers being most affected.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {However, causal estimation of the economic impact of outages is beset with the challenge of endogeneity, as the incidence and intensity of electricity outages are non-random across space and time.5 To overcome this challenge of identification, the paper uses several estimation strategies namely: instrumental variable (IV), difference-in-difference (DID), synthetic control, and panel fixed effects.

The empirical strategy of the paper is summarized as follows: In the main analysis, I use an IV strategy that exploits plausibly exogenous variations in the incidence of outages induced by variations in lightning strikes across space and time. Lightning strikes are known to be a major cause of surges in electrical systems leading to over-voltage and destruction of power infrastructure thereby causing outages (Andersen et al., 2011, Andersen et al., 2012, Andersen and Dalgaard, 2013). Leveraging this relationship between lightning activities and electricity outages, I combine granular data on measures of lightning intensity with data from the Afrobarometer dataset in 25 countries to estimate the causal effect of outages on employment. Beyond the cross-country analysis, I present two country case studies from Ghana and Nigeria. In the case of Ghana, I exploit a nationwide power crisis (“dumsor”) between 2013 and 20166 as a natural experiment to examine the impact of the power crisis on employment using a DID design, while in the case of Nigeria, I leverage detailed household panel data to examine the association between exposure to outages and employment outcomes using a fixed effect estimator. Finally, in terms of causal mechanisms, I provide evidence on the intensive and extensive margins. On the intensive margin, I use firm-level data from 10 African countries to evaluate the effect of outages on firm performance and labor demand using the same IV design. On the extensive margin, I evaluate the effect of electricity outages on (net) firm entry using data from Ethiopia and Ghana via fixed effect and synthetic control methods.}} </s>"

The study uses within-prefecture variations in cohort sizes, controlling for prefecture-pair fixed effects and flexible trends in province pairs, to identify the causal effects of cohort sizes on migration flows between origin and destination prefectures in China.
The paper examines how fertility differentials shape internal migration in China and explores the demographic impacts of migration on labor market outcomes and marriage prospects. It also investigates the moderating effects of physical distance and social network on migration costs. The study finds that fertility differentials, physical distance, and social network play significant roles in shaping internal migration in China.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {We examine how the internal migration in China in 1996–2010 responds to fertility differentials by exploiting large variations in birth cohort sizes in 331 prefectures. Unlike one-way immigration flows from developing Latin American countries to the developed U.S. Hanson and McIntosh, 2009, Hanson and McIntosh, 2010, Hanson and McIntosh, 2012, we examine bilateral migration flows among poor and rich regions within a single country. Following the renewed interest in using gravity models to identify determinants of cross-country migration (Beine et al., 2016, Ramos and Suri?ach, 2017) and China’s cross-province emigration (Poncet, 2006, Bao et al., 2009, Bao et al., 2011), we empirically estimate the gravity equation of internal migration to examine the impacts of demographic shifts over cohorts. Specifically, we exploit within-prefecture variations in cohort sizes, controlling for prefecture-pair fixed effects and flexible trends in province pairs. Variations in demographic shifts were mainly caused by the famine-induced baby boom in the 1960s and subsequent birth-control policies in the 1970s and 1980s, both of which were determined decades ago before people made migration decisions. In addition, China’s household registration (hukou) system, which used to impose stringent migration control, only started to relax in the 1990s. Our sample period,1996–2010, covers a large portion of China’s recent migration history. The stringent migration control before the 1990s and the relaxation thereafter helped rule out the reverse effect of past migration flows on birth cohort sizes. As the prime migration decisions are made approximately 20 years after the fertility shifts that caused the birth cohort size changes, these changes can be treated as predetermined to migration. Therefore, the association between changes in prefecture-level cohort size and subsequent bilateral migration flows shall be mainly attributed to the change in the cohort size itself (Hanson and McIntosh, 2010). The unique empirical setting enables us to identify the causal effects of cohort sizes on migration flows between origin and destination prefectures in China.}} </s>"

The identification strategy used in this paper is based on an experimental design where spousal observability of reported information is varied. Participants in the control group are informed that their responses will be kept private and not shared with their spouses, whereas participants in the treatment group are informed that their responses will be observable to and shared with their spouses. By comparing the information reported by the treatment and control groups, the paper aims to identify if strategic misreporting is the cause of information asymmetry between migrants and their spouses.
The core story of this paper is to analyze the extent of information asymmetry between migrants and their spouses in transnational households and determine if this can be explained by strategic misreporting. The paper finds that both migrants and their spouses have biased beliefs about each other's finances and that spouses staying behind underreport their income when it is observable to the migrant. The paper also identifies gender differences in information sharing, with women more likely to underreport income. These findings contribute to understanding household decision-making and have implications for financial products and services for transnational households.}} </s>","<s>Assistant: {In this paper, I analyze if this information asymmetry can be explained by migrants and their spouses misreporting information to each other.

The defining characteristic of misreporting is that individuals are purposefully falsifying information making it inherently difficult to identify. I address this challenge by using a novel experimental strategy to vary spousal observability of reported information.

My research design is based on the simple idea that if migrants and their spouses strategically misreport information to each other, they will differentially report this information when it is observable to the other spouse compared to when it is not. I implement this design in the context of transnational households in the UAE-Philippines migration corridor. I invite married temporary Filipino migrants in the UAE and their spouses staying behind in the Philippines to separately participate in a survey. The survey is described to participants as a research activity to create awareness about the experience of Filipino migrants in the UAE and their households in the Philippines. In the survey, I collect data on income, expenses, and employment, with the migrant reporting their information in the UAE and the spouse staying behind reporting theirs in the Philippines. I elicit the causal effect of spousal observability by experimentally varying whether the information reported by an individual in the survey is observable to their spouse.
