 </s><s>Assistant: 2：
The government launched the APRP to facilitate the relocation of poor households from remote, inhospitable areas to places with more work opportunities and a better life. As it is mainly a within-county relocation program, it moves households from villages to nearby towns or the county center by offering either public housing or housing vouchers.2 Households can choose either to move into apartments in public housing communities for free or agree on a fixed amount of subsidy (26,000 Yuan per capita) to purchase or build a new house in a preferred location within the county.
3：
Although households only moved a relatively short distance (refer to Figure E8), APRP facilitated substantial changes with regard to participating households in many aspects (refer to Section 2 and Section 5). First, households moved to less geographically isolated places. The Terrain Ruggedness Index, the average slope of the land, and commuting time to the populated area decreased, and the road density increased after relocation. Second, households moved to more developed places. Population density, electricity consumption, and area of built land were higher in destination regions, while poverty rate was lower. Third, access to amenities increased a lot after relocation because households moved to locations close to schools and health care institutions. We also provide suggestive evidence that school quality is higher in destination regions for the housing voucher group.
4：
Among all causes of poverty in rural areas, the APRP potentially tackles two problems: low productivity in agricultural sector relative to non-agricultural sector (Adamopoulos et al., 2022a; Gollin et al., 2014; Lagakos et al., 2020; Lagakos, 2020; Young, 2013) and the cost of remoteness, which prohibits access to market (Aggarwal, 2018; Asher et al., 2018; Brooks and Donovan, 2020; Provenzano, 2020; Redding and Sturm, 2008). By placing households in regions with more non-agricultural economic activities, the APRP aids in supplementing labor force shifts from agricultural to the non-agricultural sector. Besides, the APRP increases participating households’ market access by directly moving them out of remote areas. However, a positive impact on economic outcomes is not guaranteed. A within-county relocation may not be sufficient in overcoming the mobility barrier across sectors.4 For example, poor households may lack crucial skills for non-agricultural jobs. </s>"
"<s>Human: Write the 'transition program' with the information below:Program name: United States Acid Rain Program (ARP)
Enforcer: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Beginning date: 1995
Main purpose: To control sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions and reduce particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) pollution.
Development stage: Implemented and enforced.
Other information: The ARP created an immediate and persistent drop in SO2 emissions, allowing for an event study analysis to explore dynamic effects. The program regulated only certain SO2-intensive coal plants, comparing changes in mortality over time in counties most impacted by pollution from regulated plants to changes in mortality in counties with little to no related exposure. The program aimed to mitigate bias from national trends changing over time independent of pollution from coal-fired plants. The ARP generated limited economic spillovers and had negligible effects on income, employment, or migration. The program's effects on mortality rates suggest that reductions in long-term pollution concentrations contributed to declining mortality rates.
 </s><s>Assistant: 2：
In this paper, we estimate the effects of long-run pollution exposure on mortality by exploiting the United States Acid Rain Program (ARP), a cap-and-trade regulation to control sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, which avoids many of the issues associated with identifying long-run effects. First, the ARP created an immediate and persistent drop in SO2, a precursor gas in the formation of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5)1; PM2.5 is a pollutant with detrimental effects on human health (see Environmental Protection Agency (2004) for a comprehensive review). This one-time drop in pollution allows for an event study analysis to explore dynamic effects.
3:
Second, the ARP regulated only certain SO2-intensive coal plants. This lends to a design comparing changes in mortality over time in counties most impacted by pollution from regulated plants to changes in mortality in counties with little to no related exposure. This mitigates bias from national trends changing over time independent of pollution from coal-fired plants, such as business cycles, health care access, and technological advances.
4：
Third, the vast distance both SO2 and PM2.5 travel once airborne subsumes many potential confounding general equilibrium effects. Households sorting in response to the economic effects of the ARP will not bias estimates if such sorting remains within the effective range of pollution transport from a given region.2 Given existing evidence that finds such changes in housing amenity values occur at distances of less than 2 miles, long-distance residential sorting is likely to be limited.
5：Fourth, the ARP generated limited economic spillovers. While many environmental regulations often lead to job loss (Greenstone, 2002; Walker, 2013), which can have independent effects on health (Sullivan and von Wachter, 2009), this issue is less relevant to the ARP as compliance costs and economic effects were low (Schmalensee and Stavins, 2017).4 Moreover, the broad spread of emissions beyond plants themselves subsumes local economic effects, to the extent they exist, in the same way they deal with sorting. We verify the ARP had negligible effects on income, employment, or migration, suggesting economic effects are unlikely to bias estimates of health effects. </s>"

This paper investigates the complementarities between access to markets and technologies by considering the simultaneous but independently implemented expansions of rural roads and extension in Ethiopia. In the first program, starting in 2004, the government expanded extension services with a goal to provide every village with a farmer training center and three extension agents. Extension services in Ethiopia cover beyond just information sharing and include the provision of subsidized seeds, fertilizer, and credit. Since 2004, the share of farmers who received advisory services increased from 25% to 74%. The second program, the Universal Rural Road Access Program (URRAP), was commenced in 2011 with a budget of over $2 billion in order to connect every village with an all-weather road. By 2017, URRAP doubled the share of villages with an all-weather road to over 76%. The massive scale, concurrent timing and independent expansions of these two programs present an ideal context to study the interactions between access to markets and technologies.
3:
Access to a road and extension can have complementarities because poor connectivity or unavailability of technologies constrain the other factor’s efficacy.  Improvements in the road network may increase agricultural productivity by changing farmers’ access to markets and public services such as extension.  Extension can improve productivity by advising farmers on best technologies, facilitating access to inputs, mobilizing the community to address common problems, and helping households deal with shocks.  However, farmers may not benefit from market access without the relevant know-how and support provided under extension.  Poor roads limit the ability of extension agents to reach farmers.  Farmers may not undertake costly investments in technologies without profitable market opportunities.  Hence, extension and roads together have a stronger effect on productivity because they relax two interdependent rural constraints, access to markets and technologies, simultaneously. </s>"

""Main purpose"": To increase household-level sanitation and improve sanitation coverage

""Other information"": The TSC focused primarily on the provision of financial incentives and considered women to be an important target group as homemakers and caregivers. The TSC led to a significant increase in sanitation ownership among households active in the marriage market, particularly when the prospective spouse in the household is male. The TSC impact is larger in marriage markets where women are relatively scarce. The program aimed to increase the gains from marriage and improve overall sanitation coverage, but it also resulted in a reduction in the female surplus share.
 </s><s>Assistant: 2：
Our objective to quantify the added marital gain from sanitation necessarily intersects with two fundamental questions in the study of marriage markets: “Who marries whom?” and “How does the market clear?” This interlinkage poses notable identification challenges which arise from sanitation preferences being correlated with observable (e.g., wealth) and unobservable (e.g., marital preferences) characteristics that are relevant for matching decisions. Moreover, in this case, the division of the gains is endogenous and determined in the marriage market equilibrium. We use a structural approach to provide empirical evidence in support of our argument. A central contribution of this paper is to explicitly model the marriage decisions of men and women in order to decompose the total effect of sanitation programs — in our case, the Government of India (GoI)’s Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC). The TSC was a nationwide program to increase household-level sanitation and focused primarily on the provision of financial incentives. Like sanitation interventions more generally, it considered women to be an important target group as homemakers and caregivers for children, the sick, and the elderly (Cavill et al., 2018, Radtke, 2018). </s>"

In this paper, we assess the impact of the introduction of ProFuturo, an innovative CAL program present in 38 countries of three continents, which has already reached more than 450,000 teachers and 12 million children. Importantly, the package provided by the ProFuturo program enables tailoring contents to individual student needs. However, two innovative features of the program stand out, which are central to the analysis and contribution of this paper. First, ProFuturo’s main objective is to help regular primary school teachers in their core teaching activities in the classroom, i.e., after significant teacher training, ProFuturo places teachers at the center of the program’s experience. Second, it promotes student interaction with teachers and peers, namely through group work. Apart from the learning software, ProFuturo includes an equipment set composed by individual tablets, which link all students and the teacher in a classroom. We ask in this paper whether the program is effective at familiarizing students and teachers with technology while motivating and improving not only teachers’ teaching but also students’ learning experience in all major contents of regular primary school. We also investigate the effects of the implementation of ProFuturo on children’s cognitive skills
4：
We implemented a randomized field experiment to test the impact of ProFuturo. From the 42 primary schools in Luanda that were selected to receive ProFuturo, 21 were randomized to receive it in the beginning of 2018 and 21 assigned to start using it in 2019. We employ a comprehensive set of measurements, including detailed school principal, teacher, student, and household surveys, three rounds of systematic observation of classes, student standardized tests in Mathematics, Portuguese, and Science, as well as administrative data from schools and the program.
5：
Approximately a year after the program was introduced, we find that it increases the levels of technology usage for both teachers and students. Importantly, teachers’ motivation improves with ProFuturo. Specifically, the program led to a reduction in teachers’ absenteeism. The point estimate is large when employing administrative data: less 0.59 standard deviations in days missed by teachers, which represents a 51 percent reduction. Students also become more motivated, namely towards Mathematics. Central to the program and to our analysis are effects on teacher and student behaviors. Teachers improve the quality of their class preparation and engage more often in active teaching in the classroom. Students devote more time to reading, and to shared time with their guardians using technology. Some evidence also suggests more pro-social interaction between students, in line with ProFuturo’s emphasis on students’ interaction and other-regarding behaviors. Finally, we observe in classrooms higher standards of teacher knowledge. These effects of ProFuturo translate into improved students’ test scores in Science, which was the subject most frequently selected to be taught under ProFuturo. We do not find any significant treatment effects in students’ test scores of other subjects despite the centrality of those contents in the design of ProFuturo.
8：
One pedagogical approach that seems to have a role in student achievement is Computer Assisted Learning (CAL). This includes making hardware available to students along with a specific software designed to develop particular skills. In some cases, this software may adapt and respond to students’ learning needs. This approach may be particularly relevant as schools in developing countries typically have more than a grade per class, a large student–teacher ratio, and highly heterogeneous students. There are promising results of this type of interventions. </s>"

 </s><s>Assistant: 3:The 156 Program provides a natural laboratory for studying the long-term effect of aid on trade and also for examining the affinity mechanism. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union developed extensive international aid programs to build political influence (Gaddis, 2006). For instance, to establish a strategic alliance with the newly-formed Chinese government, the Soviet Union provided China with equipment and technology to help it construct large-scale industrial projects through the 156 Program. The projects substantially mitigated China's shortage of capital and technical knowledge during the initial process of industrialization. However, due to ideological disagreements, the Sino-Soviet diplomatic relationship broke down in 1960 and remained disrupted for about three decades until 1989, two years before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The termination of cooperation and Soviet collapse suggest that any current trade patterns associated with the 156 Program could hardly be a manifestation of the Soviet Union's political influence.

 </s><s>Assistant: We study the effect of the recent efforts to end the five-decade-long conflict in Colombia on business formation. In October 2012, the Colombian government started peace negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC from the Spanish acronym), the largest and oldest guerrilla organization in the Western Hemisphere. After normal ebbs and flows, the main milestone of the peace process came on December 20 of 2014, when FARC declared a permanent ceasefire as a way to signal internal cohesion and a credible commitment to lay down their weapons. The ceasefire was largely met until replaced, on August 29 of 2016, by the definitive bilateral ceasefire and, shortly afterward, by the peace agreement. FARC violence almost completely disappeared. The peace agreement, however, was rejected in a low-turnout national referendum by a 0.5 percentage points vote margin. Moreover, the political party that campaigned for the ‘No’ vote also won the 2018 presidential election, following a platform that promised to ‘tear apart’ the peace agreement. At the same time, violence in former FARC strongholds re-intensified as other armed groups that did not take part of the peace negotiations attempted to contest those territories to expand their influence. In short, the political events that started with FARC’s ceasefire entailed significant variation in violence levels as well as in political and economic uncertainty. We argue that this variation shaped the post-conflict dynamics of entrepreneurship in former FARC strongholds. </s>"

Therefore, it is important to investigate the relation between stock market volatility and expected returns in an international asset pricing model setting.

Bekaert and Harvey (1997) argue that understanding volatility in emerging capital markets is important for determining the cost of capital and for evaluating direct investment and asset allocation decisions. However, only a few papers explore the idiosyncratic volatility and its determinants in the emerging markets as well.

Development stage: Data collection and analysis
Other information: 
- The collection of data needed to assess the effect of conflict on Libyan firms has been impeded by an uncertain political environment and intense conflict-related violence.
 </s><s>Assistant: Our analysis is guided by a simple theoretical framework to study the impact of conflict exposure on firms’ activities. Firms produce by combining domestic and foreign inputs, and high-productivity firms are more intensive in foreign inputs. Conflict exposure for the firm enters the production function as a reduction in the productivity (availability) of these inputs. However, depending on the nature of the conflict, the latter affects inputs’ productivity differently. We show that an increase in conflict intensity decreases output, induces factors’ substitution, and increases firms’ exit. These effects are heterogeneous across firms depending on the intensity of the impact of conflict on different inputs and the input mix adopted by the firm. Two are the novel implications of our theoretical framework. First, the relationship between a firm’s productivity and resilience to conflict depends on the type of conflict. In particular, there is a negative (positive) relationship – i.e., low productivity firms suffer a smaller (larger) output drop – if conflict events affect relatively more (less) foreign inputs. Second, the negative effect of conflict on a firm’s output is non-linear. As conflict intensity increases, its marginal effect becomes smaller for surviving firms.

Night lights data are potentially most valuable for developing countries, because richer countries often have other sources of information on local economic activity, including more conventional data such as sub-provincial (e.g. district or county) GDP estimates.

"<s>Human: Write the 'transition program' with the information below:Program name: Innovative efficiency and stock returns
Enforcer: Not specified
Beginning date: Not specified
Main purpose: To examine the relationship between innovative efficiency and future stock returns and operating performance
Development stage: Not specified
Other information: The program focuses on the difficulty investors face in processing information about firms' future prospects, particularly in relation to new technologies and innovations. It suggests that investors tend to underreact to information about innovative efficiency, leading to undervaluation of firms that are more efficient in innovations. The program also explores the q-theory, which predicts that firms with higher innovative efficiency tend to be more profitable and have higher returns. Limited investor attention is identified as a factor that can cause underreaction and return predictability. The program constructs innovation-related factors and examines their correlation with the Efficient Minus Inefficient (EMI) factors. The EMI factors are found to have higher average monthly returns and Sharpe ratios compared to other factors, suggesting that the IE-return relation captures return predictability effects beyond those captured by other factors. The program also explores the interaction between the IE effect and proxies for limited attention and valuation uncertainty.
 </s><s>Assistant: A firm’s past innovative efficiency can be less salient to investors than explicitly forward-looking information about the prospects for the particular R&D projects that the firm is undertaking. For example, investors devote considerable attention to analyst reports and news articles about the potential outcomes of clinical phase trials conducted by a biotech and pharmaceutical firm, while historical performance of past R&D efforts receives less media attention. According to Kahneman and Lovallo (1993, p. 17), people tend to consider the judgment or decision problem they are facing as unique and, in consequence, ‘‘neglect the statistics of the past in evaluating current plans.’’ Kahneman and Lovallo call a focus on the uniqueness of the problem the ‘‘inside view’’ and a focus on relevant statistical performance data from previous trials the ‘‘outside view.’’ An excessive focus on the inside view implies that people will tend to be over[1]optimistic about prospects for success when they neglect unfavorable non-salient statistical information and tend to be less optimistic, and perhaps over-pessimistic, about the prospects of success, when they neglect favorable statistical information.

Furthermore, extensive evidence exists that individuals pay less attention to, and place less weight upon, information that is harder to process (see, e.g., the review of Song and Schwarz, 2010). Information about innovations is hard to process, because it requires developing and applying a theory of how the economic fundamentals of a firm or its industry are changing. It also requires an analysis of the road from patents to final products on the market, the profit of which can be highly uncertain and long deferred. We would expect such hard-to-process information to be underweighted unless there is some offsetting effect (such as high salience). These considerations suggest that investors will underreact to the information content in innovative efficiency because of the difficulty evaluating the eco nomic implications of patents and patent citations. If so, then firms that are more efficient in innovations will be undervalued relative to firms that are less efficient in innovations. Therefore, we expect a positive relation between innovative efficiency and future stock returns and operating performance. An alternative argument for why innovative efficiency would predict higher future returns derives from the q-theory (Cochrane, 1991, 1996; Liu, Whited, and Zhang, 2009). Firms with higher innovative efficiency tend to be more profitable and have higher return on assets. All else equal, the q-theory implies that higher profitability predicts higher returns because a high return on assets indicates that these assets were purchased by the firm at a discount (i.e., that they carry a high risk premium). Specifically, suppose that the market for capital being purchased by a firm is competitive and efficient. When a firm makes an R&D expenditure to purchase innovative capital, the price it pays is appropriately discounted for risk. For concreteness, we can think, for example, of a firm that acquires a high-tech target at a competitive market price.3 In this scenario, a firm on average achieves higher return (large number of patents, resulting in high cash flows) on its innovative expenditures as fair compensation if its purchased innovative capital is highly risky, and it receives low return if capital is relatively low-risk. Past innovative efficiency is, therefore, a proxy for risk, so firms that have high past innovative efficiency (IE) should subsequently be productive in patenting (Dierickx and Cool, 1989) and earn higher profits and stock returns.4 In other words, q-theory also predicts a positive IE-return relation. </s>"

 </s><s>Assistant: Although much research identifying the impact of air pollution on social interactions as well as health outcomes has been published, the topic of whether and how air pollution affects social conflicts has been comparatively underexplored. Social conflicts can impose substantial welfare and public costs on society, motivating us to conduct this study. In this paper, we use daily data to study the causal effects of air pollution on social conflicts in 90% of ~300 cities in China from 2014 to 2020. China serves as an ideal setting for this study due to several reasons. First, high-quality data on daily administrative social conflicts—in conjunction with daily air pollution and weather data—allow us to overcome identification problems such as measurement errors and the presence of unobserved correlated factors. Second, the detailed information on social conflicts allows us to discuss the sources of heterogeneity such as different workplaces and economic development levels, providing possible clues to enable the government to construct well-informed and targeted environmental policies to mitigate the adverse consequences of air pollution. Third, because of the large variations in air pollution in China, we are able to identify the effect of air pollution on social conflicts over a wide range of pollution exposure level, and the nonlinear estimates could provide a reference for settings in either countries with low levels of pollution (e.g., the United States and the European Union) or countries with more pronounced pollution (e.g., China and India).

""Main purpose"": To investigate how customer and supplier concentrations impact firm resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic
 </s><s>Assistant: To bring clarity to this important question, our study makes use of the dramatic changes in demand and supply during COVID-19 and investigates how such dramatic changes intertwine with customer/supplier concentration to influence firm resilience. We draw on resource-dependence theory (RDT) to understand the underlying mechanisms. RDT posits that firms de pend on external entities for resources (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Such dependent relationships vary considerably in terms of the level of relative dependence and the resultant power imbalance (Lumineau & Malhotra, 2011). When a party possesses more critical and scarce resources, it has more power over its counter parts, and power imbalance occurs (Emerson, 1962). Power-unbalanced relationships are more likely to trig ger opportunistic and exploitative behaviors and a focus on self-interest (Casciaro & Piskorski, 2005; Cheng et al., 2021; Karanovic et al., 2021), whereas power balanced relationships are more likely to lead to collaborative interactions and a focus on mutual interests. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License (Kumar et al., 1998). We postulate that the dramatic shifts in demand and supply during the pandemic reshape resource dependence within supply chains (Craighead et al., 2020), alleviating or worsening the power imbalance issues between firms and their concentrated partners and thus shaping the effect of customer and supplier concentrations on firm resilience.

Specifically, considering the divergent patterns of demand and supply shifts in different stages of the pan demic, our study focuses on both the disruption and resto ration stages. During the disruption stage, when the demand for most products drops, the downstream parties reduce their dependence on upstream parties for inputs, whereas the upstream parties increase their dependence on downstream parties for orders and revenues. As a result, the power relationship between focal firms and their concentrated customers is more unbalanced, and that with concentrated suppliers is more balanced. During the restoration stage, when demand soars and supply becomes the bottleneck, the downstream parties increase their dependence on upstream parties for inputs, whereas the upstream parties are overwhelmed with demand and less dependent on downstream parties for orders. Consequently, the power relationship between focal firms and their concentrated customers is more balanced, and that with concentrated suppliers is more unbalanced. Accordingly, we postulate that customer concentration is detrimental in the disruption stage and becomes beneficial in the restoration stage; supplier concentration is beneficial in the disruption stage but becomes detrimental in the restoration stage. </s>"

 </s><s>Assistant: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with an average annual economic growth of approximately 5.3% between 2007 and 2019. In which Vietnam is one of the leaders in economic performance1 and considered as Asia’s next dragon. Under this stellar performance, the banking system is the backbone of the Vietnamese economy since the stock market is relatively underdeveloped. Healthy and sustainable profitability is one of the main predictors of financial distress and a bank crisis (Demirgüç-Kunt & Detragiache, 2000). This also reflects the quality of management, shareholder’s behavior, bank’s competitive strategies, efficiency, and risk management capacity. As IC is one of the increasingly important factors contributing to the success of banks, it is crucial to investigate whether IC has any effect on bank profitability in Vietnam. Since entering to World Trade Organization in 2007, the presence of foreign banks in the market has increased. Two forms of foreign participation are a green-field investment and the acquisitions of a minority share.2 The presence of foreign-owned banks resulted in fierce competition for deposits and loans, thereby may affect domestic banks’ profitability. In response, along with shifting towards non-traditional activities, domestic banks should further improve their IC efficiency. Furthermore, the market also has witnessed the increasing competition between state-owned commercial banks and privately owned commercial banks (Le et al., 2019). This competitiveness puts further pressure on banks to maintain a stable source of income. These banks should consider IC efficiency as their long-term goal. Given the diversified structure of the Vietnamese banking system, this necessitates conducting empirical research to investigate whether IC could enhance bank profitability in Vietnam. </s>"

 </s><s>Assistant: Notably, the recent rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies brings new challenges for companies concerning CSR. AI is a core disruptive technology in Industry 4.0 that includes neural networks, machine learning, natural language processing, and image processing. It has become increasingly popular in processing big data and providing solutions for many industries (e.g., Cui et al. 2020b, Leachman and Merlino 2017, Li et al. 2016). For example, AI-empowered chatbots are found to significantly improve the effectiveness of inexperienced workers (Luo et al. 2019). Given the clear benefit of AI, an increasing number of companies are deploying AI more innovatively for their business. Nearly 50% of the respondents to a survey conducted by McKinsey said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business unit in 2020 (Balakrishnan et al. 2020). Nevertheless, the popularity of AI has also raised increasing concerns about AI ethics such as large[1]scale layoffs, data security, and privacy issues. McKinsey’s survey showed that 39% of the respondents thought individual privacy was a risk relative to AI that they should consider (Balakrishnan et al. 2020), and another survey showed that 59% of AI tech workers have experience working on products that they feel might be harmful to society (Miller and Coldicutt 2019). The serious concerns about AI ethics require high AI innovation (AII) firms to give greater consideration to CSR, especially in the process of AI implementation.1 In this regard, the intended effect of conducting CSR on the associated risk may be affected in the presence of firms’ AII. Additionally, as AII is a strong differentiation strategy, can firms with high AII still benefit from the differentiation effect of CSR? This scenario forces companies to reconsider their CSR strategies. Will AII influence the impact of CSR? How can a company’s CSR strategy be adjusted according to its level of AII?

There may be two opposite ways in which AII moderates the impact of CSR on IR. The public’s high CSR expectation of high-AII firms (discussed above) may weaken the positive effect of CSR as stakeholders may take companies’ CSR efforts for granted such as providing staff training to help them counter the risk of unemployment. From the perspective of RBV, AII is also a differentiation strategy for enterprises that may be even more effective than CSR (Hull and Rothenberg 2008). Companies with high AII may have already differentiated themselves well, which can limit the positive effect of CSR. In contrast, it is also possible that companies with high AII have a good degree of recognition; thus, their CSR is more likely to be noticed by other stakeholders, which may strengthen the positive effect of CSR (Mishra 2017). Motivated by these conflicting effects, this paper aims to confirm AII’s moderating effect to help companies develop an optimal CSR strategy. </s>"
"<s>Human: Write the 'transition program' with the information below:Program name: Incorporating Counties into Prefectures Reform (chexian shequ)
Enforcer: Chinese central government
Beginning date: Not specified in the given paragraphs
Main purpose: To centralize administrative control and eliminate regulatory and administrative barriers between counties and prefectures in China
 </s><s>Assistant: The incorporation of counties into prefectures is a centralization effort by the Chinese central government. In China, counties were independent administrative entities with their own local governments. Prefecture-level divisions (referred to as “prefecture” hereafter) were higher-level administrative units that oversaw regional policies and coordination between counties.2 Before the reform, there were often regulatory and administrative barriers between counties and prefectures, which could lead to inefficient resource allocation. The incorporation reform merged a county into the prefecture that used to oversee it, resulting in the county governments losing some of their autonomy and becoming agencies of the prefecture-level government. The barriers between the county and the prefecture disappeared, and the two local markets were expected to integrate more closely. </s>"

Enforcer: Central government of China
Beginning date: 1978 (since the country's economic reform and open up)
Main purpose: To promote development and economic growth
Development stage: By 2021, there are over 15,000 various EZs (national level, provincial level, and lower level)
Other information: EZs contribute to more than 30% of China's GDP and one-third of its foreign direct investment. The central government provides strong support and grants EZs a high degree of autonomy. EZs have been successful in increasing local capital investment, employment, output, productivity, and average wages.
 </s><s>Assistant: Policymakers throughout the world widely pursue place-based policies as an important instrument to bolster local economies (Neumark and Simpson, 2015). For example, the United States has a large number of programs using state enterprise zones to improve local labor markets (Ham et al., 2011, Austin et al., 2018). France and the United Kingdom introduced similar enterprise zone policies to support business growth (Gobillon et al., 2012). As the largest developing country, China has implemented place-based policies in economic zones (EZs) to promote development since the country’s economic reform and open up in 1978. As of 2018, 2,543 national-level and provincial-level EZs encompassed almost every Chinese city, covering a total area of 17,973.89 square kilometers.1 The central government has provided strong support and granted zones with a high degree of autonomy, making EZs a tremendously successful economic tool (Wang, 2013). By 2021, the number of various zones (national level, provincial level, and lower level) has risen to over 15,000, contributing to more than 30% of China’s GDP and one-third of its foreign direct investment.2 The popularity of place-based policies has drawn increasing attention from researchers. Many studies have investigated the economic impacts of place-based policies, including job creation (Neumark and Kolko, 2010, Kolko and Neumark, 2010), capital investment, output, the number of firms (Chaurey, 2017), tariffs (Grant, 2020), welfare (Blouri and Ehrlich, 2020), economic activity density (Ehrlich and Seidel, 2018), and spillover effects (Greenstone et al., 2010, Alkon, 2018). In the context of China, several studies have shown that China’s EZ programs significantly increased local capital investment, employment, output, productivity, and average wages (Wang, 2013, Zheng et al., 2017, Lu et al., 2019). </s>"

Enforcer: Commercial banks in China
Beginning date: 2004
Main purpose: To provide a financial innovation for households to invest their savings in the real economy
Development stage: Established and widely used
Other information: WMPs are the second-largest type of non-housing investments for households in China, with a total value of outstanding WMPs reaching RMB 29.54 trillion (approximately USD 4.25 trillion) at the end of 2017. WMPs are sold by banks to households, who then invest the raised money into underlying assets such as loans, bonds, equities, money-market rates, foreign currencies, and commodities. The risk of WMPs is lower than other investment tools, while the return is higher than bank deposits. Each WMP requires a minimum investment of usually above RMB 50,000 (approximately USD 7,200). Selling WMPs and investing the raised money belong to banks' off-balance-sheet activities.
 </s><s>Assistant: WMPs are the second-largest type of non-housing investments for households in China, next to stocks. As the largest component of China's shadow-banking sector, WMPs are a very important channel through which households' savings are invested in the real economy. WMPs are a financial innovation that was initiated in 2004 by commercial banks in China. Banks design the terms in the contracts of WMPs (including the promised yields), sell the WMPs to households, and then invest the raised money into underlying assets (including loans, bonds, equities, money-market rates, foreign currencies, and commodities such as gold).2 Fig. 1 displays the investment cash flows among households, WMPs, and the underlying assets. The type of underlying assets of a WMP is specified in the contract at the time of issuance. Afterward, banks distribute part of the revenue generated from the underlying assets to the WMP buyers as the principal and interest payments according to the agreement. The realized returns of the underlying assets are not visible to the WMP buyers. The risk of WMPs is much lower than that of other investment tools, such as stocks and commercial bonds; while the return on WMPs is much higher than that on bank deposits. Each WMP requires a minimum investment for a buyer, usually above RMB 50,000 (approximately USD 7,200). Different from receiving deposits and making loans, selling WMPs and investing the money raised from WMPs belong to banks' off-balance-sheet activities rather than on-balance-sheet activities. At the end of 2017, the total value of outstanding WMPs reached RMB 29.54 trillion (approximately USD 4.25 trillion). During 2017, banks issued 93,500 individual WMPs. </s>"

Beginning date: 2010
Main purpose: To explore student behavior when educational markets become more integrated
Development stage: Quasi-experimental design
Other information: 
- Eight private off-platform universities joined the platform (G8), while remaining private universities stayed off the platform (OP)
- G8 universities are located in four commuting zones in Chile
- The inclusion of G8 universities increased the number of platform seats offered by 37%
- The analysis uses individual level administrative data on high school graduates, including exam scores, platform applications, and university progression data
- The platform integration increased the number of platform users by 13 percentage points and decreased the proportion of students rejecting a G25 offer
- One year after the integration, student's G8 enrollment increased by 3pp. and G25 enrollment decreased by 1.6pp.
- Low-income students were 3.6pp. more likely to enroll in university after the integration
- Results are robust to alternative explanations, including changes in test-taking behavior, preferences for G8 universities, and location restrictions
 </s><s>Assistant: The inclusion of eight new universities to Chile's already-existing centralized admission platform provides an ideal setting to explore the student's behavior when educational markets become more integrated, using a quasi-experimental design. In 2010, the 25 universities managing and operating the centralized admission system (G25) invited the remaining private off-platform universities to join the platform. Eight universities joined the platform (G8), while the remaining private universities stayed off the platform (OP). The G8 are located in four commuting zones in Chile, and their inclusion increased the number of platform seats offered by 37%. Following Card, 1995; Currie and Moretti (2003); Cantoni and Yuchtman (2014), we exploit the fact that students tend to enroll in a university that is close to their home and conduct a difference-in-difference analysis comparing students graduating from high schools in commuting zones that have a G8 (G8 CZ) and do not have G8 (non-G8 CZ) in it.6 </s>"

Yet little is known about the economic impact of unreliable electricity provision. Available studies on the impact of electricity outages have largely focused on the extent to which outages affect firm productivity (Allcott et al., 2016, Abeberese et al., 2021) and profitability (Cole et al., 2018, Hardy and McCasland, 2019). An important yet often ignored question is the extent to which persistent outages affect job creation and consequently, the rate of unemployment in the developing world. </s>"
