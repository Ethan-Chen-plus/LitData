Exposure to collective gender-based violence causes intimate partner violence,"10：
Our central result is that a man ’s exposure to wartime sexual violence against women as a soldier significantly increases his pro pensity to commit violence against a female intimate partner more than a decade after the end of the war and, on average, about 18 years after exposure. We contend that this effect is not driven by local effects, omitted individual variables, measurement error, linear model specification, mis-specified inter-correlations in the error term or the choice of our preferred instrumental variable specification.
11：
We present empirical evidence to argue that the underlying mechanism is a lasting reduction in self-control, fostering more impulsive and automatic responses to critical situations with their partner. Surprisingly, we find no support for alternative theories based on living up to norms of gender, social models of violence, distress or a reduction in economic bargaining power, which have dominated explanations of intimate partner violence in across disciplines. Our findings are consistent with an interpretation of IPV as ‘expressive’ behavior, where men intrinsically value the expression of violence and violent acts may arise as an unintended outcome.","3：
This paper studies the causal long-run impacts of individual experiences on intimate partner violence. Specifically, we focus on exposure to collective gender-based violence and ask how wartime exposure to sexual violence against women affects veterans’ long-run propensity to commit intimate partner violence.

We study the impact of exposure to wartime sexual violence for two?main reasons. First, perpetrating or witnessing violence is often associated with engaging in violent behavior in the future – ‘violence begets violence’ (Pollak, 2004; Littman and Paluck, 2015). Second, sexual violence is among the most intense and recurring forms of gender-based violence and war atrocities,affecting millions of people across the world as victims and perpetrators. Starting with events in Bosnia and Rwanda, awareness for wartime sexual violence in the globalpolicy discourse has increased rapidly, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820 recognizes that “rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutiveact with respectto genocide” (UN, 2008, p. 3). Nonetheless, armed groups around the world continue to perpetrate sexual violence, including contexts as diverse as Liberia, Eastern Congo, Colombia, Timor–Leste, Pakistan, or Iraq and Syria (Cohen et al., 2013).","""1"": ""Globally, one in three women experience domestic violence in their lifetime"",  ""2"": ""Identifying reliable policies of preventing and reducing domestic violence is proving difficult"",  ""3"": ""Exposure to collective gender-based violence is studied to understand its impact on intimate partner violence"",  ""4"": ""Sexual violence is among the most intense and recurring forms of gender-based violence and war atrocities"",  ""5"": ""Awareness for wartime sexual violence in the global policy discourse has increased rapidly"",  ""6"": ""Existing research on the drivers of intimate partner violence is limited and lacks cohesion"",  ""7"": ""The study focuses on the long-run impacts of exposure to collective gender-based violence on intimate partner violence"",  ""8"": ""High quality micro-level data on conflict experiences beyond exposure to battlefield violence is scarce"",  ""9"": ""Unobserved individual-level factors may vary simultaneously with wartime exposure to sexual violence and domestic violence today"",  ""10"": ""The study collected detailed primary survey data on exposure to wartime sexual violence and intimate partner violence"",  ""11"": ""The identification strategy relies on a natural experiment in Huambo province, Angola"",  ""12"": ""The Angolan Civil War created exogenous variation in exposure to wartime sexual violence against women"",  ""13"": ""Men born about 20 years before spikes in wartime sexual violence were at a much higher risk of exposure"",  ""14"": ""Exposure to wartime sexual violence significantly increases the propensity to commit violence against a female intimate partner"",  ""15"": ""The underlying mechanism is a lasting reduction in self-control"","
Live tutoring calls did not improve learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sierra Leone,"5：
We find no effect of calls by either private or government teachers on mathematics or language test scores. This is robust to controls for student characteristics and school fixed effects, and differences in survey mode (in-person or phone). We do find some positive effects of tutoring calls on educational engagement by parents and children. Tutoring calls increase an index of student activity by 0.29 standard deviations and an index of parent activity by 0.27 standard deviations. Within this index, however, we see no statistically significant effect on the probability that children listened to educational radio, and only a 4 percentage point increase (significant at the 10 percent level) in the probability that their parent knew the correct FM frequency.
6：
Re-enrolment was over 99 percent even in the control group, so we see no effect of calls on re-enrolment. Private school teachers (who were directly managed by the project implementer) did exert greater effort than the government school teachers. Private school teachers placed 59 percent of planned calls, compared to 41 percent for government school teachers. But this extra effort did not translate to any difference in student outcomes. This lack of a difference in outcomes across implementers – despite a difference in implementation fidelity suggests that the null finding results not from an implementation failure but in the effectiveness of the intervention itself. Many students did not listen to educational radio at all (43 percent in the control group and 34 percent in the treatment group), so low uptake of the educational radio is potential part of the reason for a lack of impact on student learning.","2:
To keep students engaged and learning during school closures, governments around the world abruptly shifted to distance learning.?In low-income countries, the medium with the greatest reach is radio. The Government of Sierra Leone, like many others, announced a national radio teaching programme shortly after schools closed in March 2020. Many governments and partners complemented radio teaching with SMS-based reminders. In Sierra Leone, a number of non-state organisations, including our implementation partner Rising Academy Network, supported the Government to develop content for the radio teaching programme and provided SMS reminders. Missing from these and similar efforts, however, is any direct interaction between teachers and students. Teachers add significant value to student learning (Chetty et al., 2014), but little of that value is explained by teacher characteristics (Bau and Das, 2020), suggesting that effective interactions may drive teacher effects.","""1"": ""School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in children missing out on direct learning in classrooms."",  ""2"": ""Distance learning was implemented during school closures, with radio being the medium with the greatest reach in low-income countries like Sierra Leone."","
Manufacturing employment and women’s agency: Evidence from Lesotho 2004–2014,,"2：
The paper contributes to the sparse literature identifying causal impacts of manufacturing work on the agency of women in poor countries. The combined shocks to textile demand from the US durig the 200809 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and the gradual phase-out of the MFA together resulted in a large, temporary, decline in RMG employment in Lesotho. Because of the lack of other well-paid employment for women, these shocks to RMG demand provide an opportunity to examine the impact of a high-wage, formalised work environment on women’s say in resource allocation in households and measures of women’s health. A pseudo-panel spanning 2004–2014 is constructed to identify causal impacts of RMG employment on these outcomes. Women who reside closer to potential RMG employment are more likely to work in the?sector. Exogenous variation in RMG employment propensities from the combination of distance between a woman’s residence and the nearest IZ and these demand shocks is exploited for inference.

The RMG sector began in the early 1980s with investments from South Africa. These investments were facilitated by the Lesotho National Development Cooperation. Investors could circumvent sanctions on South Africa which otherwise prevented selling to the US and European markets (UNCTAD, 2002, Steele, 2002, Gibbon, 2003). By 2004, the RMG sector had become the main non-agricultural employer in Lesotho, engaged more formal-sector workers than the government, and was the source of a majority of export revenue (Lall, 2006, International Finance Corporation, 2010). Under AGOA, foreign direct investment in Lesotho increased substantially (Central Bank of Lesotho, 2004, Central Bank of Lesotho, 2005). The sector is dominated by Taiwanese and South African-owned factories producing for the US market (Balchin and Calabrese, 2019, World Trade Organization, 2017). As of 2017, about 82% of workers were women. In 2017, the RMG sector employed about 46500 workers in Lesotho, down from a peak of 54 000 in early 2003 (Lesotho Ministry of Trade and Industry, 2017).

RMG production is concentrated primarily in the suburbs of Maseru, the national capital, and Thetsane, Mafeteng, Leribe and Mohale’s Hoek. The Maseru zone remains the largest employer, likely because transportation costs for finished goods are lowest from this location. The proximity of the Maseru suburbs to the railhead leading to the South African sea port of Durban also lowers lag time between orders and deliveries.

Wages and working conditions in the RMG sector are strongly regulated in Lesotho. A child labour ban is enforced by the government. RMG sector workers are also generally unionised, and may have access to on-site childcare and healthcare (Gibbon, 2003). Factories operating in the IZs pay much higher wages both relative to local alternatives and relative to those paid in other RMG host countries including Vietnam and Bangladesh. In 2007, the average monthly earnings of an employee in the RMG sector was $US 103, and the minimum monthly earnings for a general textile worker in Lesotho was $US 93 (RMG Bangladesh, 2016). In 2007, annual GDP per capita was far lower: 846 current US$, a monthly equivalent of 71 US$ (World Bank, 2022b). Still, production costs were internationally competitive in the early 2000s. Eifert et al. (2005) calculated the labour costs per shirt produced in Lesotho in 2004 as 0.19 current US dollars, far under the 0.65 for South Africa and 0.29 for export processing zones in China. The minimum monthly earnings for a textile worker had risen to $US 138 by August 2018 (Abdullah Al Mahfuz, 2018).","""1"": ""The paper examines the impact of women's employment in export-oriented textile manufacturing in Lesotho on decision-making in poor households."",  ""2"": ""The paper focuses on the effects of RMG employment on women's agency, resource allocation in households, and women's health."",  ""3"": ""RMG exports in Lesotho grew rapidly after the signing of the US African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) in May 2000."",  ""4"": ""The first AGOA agreement guaranteed duty-free status on imports to the US from beneficiary countries until at least September 2008."",  ""5"": ""The AGOA agreement created incentives for large-scale foreign direct investment in garment manufacturing facilities and for national governments to invest in industrial zones (IZs)."",  ""6"": ""By 2012, Lesotho became the largest Sub-Saharan African exporter of garments to the US."",  ""7"": ""RMG employment in Lesotho provided many women with their first opportunity to earn money outside of agriculture."",  ""8"": ""The combined shocks to textile demand from the US during the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis and the gradual phase-out of the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) resulted in a large, temporary decline in RMG employment in Lesotho."",  ""9"": ""The paper constructs a pseudo-panel spanning 2004-2014 to identify causal impacts of RMG employment on women's agency."",  ""10"": ""Women who reside closer to potential RMG employment are more likely to work in the sector."",  ""11"": ""The paper exploits exogenous variation in RMG employment propensities from the combination of distance between a woman's residence and the nearest IZ and demand shocks."",  ""12"": ""The RMG sector in Lesotho began in the early 1980s with investments from South Africa, facilitated by the Lesotho National Development Cooperation."",  ""13"": ""Foreign direct investment in Lesotho increased substantially under AGOA."",  ""14"": ""The RMG sector in Lesotho is dominated by Taiwanese and South African-owned factories producing for the US market."",  ""15"": ""As of 2017, about 82% of workers in the RMG sector in Lesotho were women."","
Social and financial incentives for overcoming a collective action problem,"8：
We find that group-level monetary reward has the strongest impact in the short term, inducing an 7.5 to 12.5 percentage point (pp) increase in the share of households with hygienic latrines. The public commitment treatment caused a 4.2 to 6.3 pp increase in that same period. Neither the non-monetary reward nor the private commitment treatments had statistically significant impacts. In the medium term, the effect of the monetary reward dissipates relative to the comparison group, while the effect of the public commitment treatment persists. We find that in the case of both the monetary reward and public commitment treatments, households tended to meet the short-run assessment criteria for hygienic status through small, relatively inexpensive improvements to or repairs of existing latrines, rather than making large investments in major improvements or on entirely new latrines. In the public commitment group, households tended to maintain these small?improvements into the medium-term, while those in the monetary reward group tended to let these improvements depreciate.","2：
Since these pathogens are communicable, a large portion of the health gains from a household’s use of a hygienic latrine likely accrue to other households in the community (Fuller et al., 2016, Andrés et al., 2017).  This creates a divergence between the incidence of benefits and costs, and with it, a classic collective action problem — while it may be in all households’ interests collectively for all households to use and maintain hygienic latrines, any individual household may not find these behaviors privately optimal.:With strong institutions, regulation mandating adoption and enforcing use can solve this problem.  However, in the absence of such institutions, other tools are required.","""1"": ""Open defecation is practiced by one billion people worldwide, leading to the spread of infections and child stunting."",  ""2"": ""The health benefits of using hygienic latrines extend to other households in the community."","
The political impacts of land expropriation in China,"8：
I begin by estimating the overall political impacts. The empirical finding is that if households have directly experienced land expropriation, both political beliefs and political behavior of individuals in these households are affected. Specifically, exposure to land expropriation decreases individuals’ trust towards local government officials by 0.07 standard deviations, which is equal to about 36% of the mean difference in political trust between individuals with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) membership and those without. In addition, exposure to land expropriation increases the probability of having conflicts with local government officials by about 2.5%, compared to a sample mean of 5%, which means it increases the incidence of experiencing conflicts with government officials by around 50%. These adverse effects imply that expropriating land is indeed politically costly for local governments. The results are robust to a variety of internal validity checks.
9：
The empirical analysis also yields three important findings, which further have some important political implications. First, the dynamic estimates show that the effects on both political outcomes are not persistent, instead, they eventually attenuate to zero about four years after treatment. Second, I do not find statistically significant spillover effects, suggesting that the control group of non-expropriated individuals is not affected by the expropriation of the land of their neighbors. Last, individuals subject to expropriation also negatively assess government service and quality, but the effects are significant and remarkable only in the short run. Taken together, these results suggest that the adverse political impacts are not persistent and restrictive to those affected only. In other words, to some extent, land expropriation in rural areas may not pose a fatal threat to China’s political regime.
10：
The Wukan example is by no means the only way in which how land takings occur in China. It epitomizes the worse possible features of land seizures (i.e., low compensation, no ex-ante negotiation, corruption, abuse of enforcement, no public benefits). Arguably, the outcomes could be different if the expropriation does not occur in that way. For instance, one may ask what would be the consequences if the projects are well managed and justified by local governments and/or the land is taken for public use (e.g., expressways and high-speed rail). To this end, I next turn to consider the role of compensation in determining the political effects, and the extent to which the adverse political impacts depend upon governance quality, the public benefits of projects, and the importance of the agricultural land for affected households.
11：
Of course, many factors could intermediate the relationship between land expropriation and political outcomes. I provide four insights into this link. First, I provide evidence that households’ economic wellbeing is not significantly affected by land expropriation, given that (i) land expropriation does not create negative shocks to total household income,8 and (ii) saving asset (bank deposits and cash) of affected households increases, even though it is not persistent. However, compared to the market value of the land, the compensation is very low, indicative of an uneven redistribution of land rents between farmers and local government and property developers, which is likely to be perceived by farmers as unfair. This view is supported by a comparison with urban housing demolition which produces large, positive wealth shocks to affected households and has no impact on political outcomes.9 Second, I find that the adverse political impacts can largely be avoided by sound local governance as reflected by (i) availability of information?about the expropriation projects at the village level, (ii) high government transparency level, and (iii) low government corruption level. Third, the political costs also can be reduced or even eliminated in villages that experience infrastructure improvement (e.g., gaining access to roads and railways or providing electricity or tap water) during the same period when villagers have their land expropriated. Last, the adverse political impacts are less salient for households with at least one member working in the non-agricultural sector before having their land expropriated. In other words, the political costs appear to arise mainly from perceived unfairness of compensation and nontransparent governance and can be reduced when projects generate public benefits or households depend less on agriculture.","2:
State expropriation is generally justified by the public interest. The state is expected to employ expropriation as a policy tool to provide?public goods and to develop the economy more generally.3 Since these goals deliver benefits to the public, whether expropriation has political costs, and if so, how detrimental the costs are, could be contextdependent. Public perceptions of the motivations for expropriation could influence the extent to which expropriation leads to adverse political impacts. To explore this relationship, this study examines two circumstances that may enable the state to implement expropriation projects without losing citizens’ political support. First, if local officials have a reputation for good governance, the expropriation projects are likely to be well managed and justified and the process of expropriation may be implemented in a manner which is more transparent. In this case, state expropriation may not necessarily have high political costs. Second, public use of the expropriated resources may be important. When the projects generate public benefits, the interests of both the government and the citizens are aligned and adverse political impacts may not emerge.

China provides an excellent empirical setting to study the political consequences of state expropriation. As the world’s largest developing country, China has employed land expropriation to support development policies for several decades. Local governments have the authority to seize agricultural land and provide relatively low compensation. It is striking that, according to the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a nationally representative longitudinal survey, the proportion of households who have had at least some of their land expropriated by 2018 was 30% (see Fig. 1). There is no doubt that land expropriation has contributed to China’s economic development and growth by facilitating infrastructure construction and urbanization.4 However, are there political costs associated with this development policy? And if so, is it possible for the government to mitigate the costs? Little is known quantitatively about these questions, although they are of great interest and policy relevance.
4：
This paper argues that land expropriation incurs political costs for the Chinese government. The Wukan event, which attracted worldwide attention, provides a vivid illustration.5 In September 2011, Wukan villagers launched large-scale violent protests against the government after they discovered that the village and township governments transferred more than half of their agricultural land to a private real estate company without ex-ante negotiation or providing proper compensation to villagers. Some managers including the vice-CEO of the private company were village cadres, suggesting that corruption may have occurred at the local level.6 Before organizing the protests, the villagers?petitioned the provincial government but received no satisfactory resolution. After interacting with local government officials, some villagers were arrested and jailed; and one died after being arrested by the police. During the process, the villagers gradually lost their trust in the local government and called for an investigation by the central government. Finally, a peaceful agreement between the villagers and the government was reached after a top provincial leader intervened and acknowledged the villagers’ basic demands.","""1"": ""State expropriation is common in human history and prevalent in developing countries.

Trade-induced competition and ownership dynamics,"6：
We focus on domestic private firms in the analysis. In contrast to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) which possess natural political connections that help them resist competitive pressures, or foreign-controlled firms, which are themselves the major beneficiaries of trade liberalization, domestic private firms are more susceptible to trade-induced competition. Our results are robust to the inclusion of all firms, but the sample with a clearly defined ownership group provides a cleaner estimate of ownership changes than the all-firmsample. Moreover, since China’s opening policy commenced and a few decades of economic reforms have occurred, private firms have become an important component of the national economy. According to the latest statistics based on the annual surveys of industrial firms in China, domestic private firms account for more than 75% of all enterprises and contribute about 60% of China’s employment and output.8 With this representative sample of Chinese firms, we find that the firms more affected by the intensified import competition do not alter their state ownership but relatively increase their foreign ownership compared with the less affected firms. The magnitude of the increaseis considerable. A one-standard-deviation increase in the shock intensity is associated with a relative increase of 0.03 standard deviations in foreign ownership ratio, which accounts for 11% of its sample mean. If we consider firms in the top versus bottom decile of the trade shock, those more shocked by the trade liberalization increase their foreign ownership more than those less shocked by an amount accounting for 24% (7%) of the sample mean (standard deviation).
7：
We explore the heterogeneity of firm responses along theoretically motivated dimensions. First, we examine how firm responses vary between regions with different economic conditions and institutional environments. We find that the baseline patterns of change in foreign ownership are mainly concentrated in more developed regions, as characterized by greater regional gross domestic product (GDP), higher household consumption, and better infrastructure development, and in regions with better functioning markets and institutions, which feature less government intervention, less local protectionism, more mature legal systems, and stronger support for innovation compared with other regions. Second, we explore two potential channels through which foreign shareholders can help firms respondto competitive shocks. First, we find that comparedwith other firms, those in industries with a larger innovation gap relative to the international technology frontiers and?with greater reliance on labor versus physical capital have more incentives to introduce foreign shareholders because they can benefitfrom the adoption of advanced technologies through the participation of foreign investors. Second, we use US industries as the benchmark and compare firms in industries with more versus less dependence on external finance. We find that firms with greater financing needs do indeed have a greater relative increase in foreign shareholders than firms with less dependence on external financing. This result lends support to the financing channel, which suggests that firms sell their equity to foreign investors to circumvent financial constraints. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the strategic role of ownership in strengthening the competitiveness of firms and suggest that product market competition is an important force in ownership dynamics.","2.
As a fundamental market force, product market competition has become more intense in recent decades. Waves of trade liberalization, including recent developments in China, have significantly shifted the domestic landscape of competition and induced firms to transform themselves in various ways (Bloom et al., 2016). We use the largesttrade liberalization in China, marked by China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001, to examine whether and how firms alter their ownership choices in response to trade-induced?competition.2 Abundant anecdotal evidence suggests that firm managers consider the nature and potential roles of ownersas a core aspectof their firms’ strategy sets and activelyconsider whether to adjust ownership to strengthen firms’ competitiveness. For example, Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, the largest construction machinery manufacturer and distributor in China, has actively sought to introduce strategic investors since 2002 to facilitate its structural reform, improve its technology management expertise and corporate governance, and raise capital.3 More recently, Suning.com, a large online retailer in China, introduced government-backed strategic investors to mitigate its financial distress and reduce operational frictions.4 Given the strategic roles that different ownership types can play in a competitiveenvironment, we hypothesize that certain changes in state and foreign shareholders are avenues for firms to strengthen their competitiveness.","""1"": ""Corporate ownership structure has significant impacts on corporate policies and activities, such as governance, financing, investment, and innovation."",  ""2"": ""Product market competition has become more intense in recent decades, especially with China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001."",  ""3"": ""Firms may seek to increase their state ownership as competition increases, as state shareholders can provide greater financing capacity and favorable treatment in capital and product markets."",  ""4"": ""Firms may seek to increase their foreign ownership in response to competitive shocks, as foreign shareholders can improve corporate governance, promote technology transfers and innovation, alleviate financial constraints, and provide better access to global capital markets."","
Fighting violence against women: The role of female political representation,"5：
We find that the presence of a female mayor in Brazilian municipalities is associated with a significant and sizable reduction in domestic violence against women of relevant age (between 15 and 49) over the 4-year term: around 50% reduction for both femicide and other measures of violence against women (physical violence, psychological violence, sexual violence). Furthermore, our analysis revealed a reduction in total violence (including non-domestic violence) but did not observe an impact on the total number of homicides. Our results are robust to the inclusion of standard controls and to several validation and falsification tests. In particular, we do not find an effect on violent crime against men, general mortality, the motor vehicle accident fatality rate, and the suicide rate for both males and females, separately. It is worth stressing, that by using the number of murders as one of the proxy for violence helps in addressing issues of under-reporting which might be present for less extreme acts of violence.3 To clearly identify the mechanisms that explain such results is challenging. From existing evidence and some novel results we suggest that female mayors have an increased attention to policies that might favor women welfare, however we do not find clear evidence that female mayors are more likely than men to introduce women’s shelter or women police stations, policies that are managed and implemented by state governors.","2:
As emphasized by the United Nations in its sustainable development goal, “eliminating all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres” is a crucial objective to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Official statistics provide a clear picture of this global tragedy. One in three women worldwide experience physical or sexual violence affecting both women’s well-being and their participation in society and politics.1 Moreover, more than 50% of homicides with female victims are perpetrated by intimate partners or other family members.2 Despite being a global issue, violence against women is much more prevalent in low and lower-middle income countries and regions, forcing many countries to adopt specific legislation to criminalize femicide and gender-based violence. For instance in Brazil, according to official statistics, a woman is killed every two hours and assaulted every 15 s (Cerqueira and Bueno, 2020).","""1"": ""Female political representation has been found to be more socially oriented than male representation."",  ""2"": ""Violence against women is a global issue, with one in three women worldwide experiencing physical or sexual violence."",  ""3"": ""The share of women in politics has significantly increased in almost every country, shaping social and economic policy."",  ""4"": ""Identifying the causal effects of female leaders on violence is challenging due to potential municipality characteristics that correlate with both female leadership and violence against women."",  ""5"": ""The presence of a female mayor in Brazilian municipalities is associated with a significant reduction in domestic violence against women, including femicide, physical violence, psychological violence, and sexual violence."","
Seeing Is Believing- Can Increasing the Number of Female Leaders Reduce Sex Selection in Rural India?,"7：
By investigating child death rates, I test whether the underlying mechanism is that changes in health services disproportionately favored highest birth order girls. I do not find that high birth order girls, amongst children who have survived infancy, have different survival rates during early childhood than girls in general, suggesting that health services remained constant across birth orders. I also test the claim that female leaders directly reduced sex selection fertility services by investigating the impact of female reservations on sex ratios across different socioeconomic statuses. Studies have shown that the use of sex selective abortions is most common amongst more educated women, and less educated women do not appear to rely on abortions as a method of sex selection (Jha et al., 2011, P?rtner, 2016). Thus, restriction of fertility services should more directly impact more educated women. I find that the effects in this paper are strongest for poor and illiterate women, suggesting that the restriction of fertility services likely does not explain the results. Rather, because the least educated women do not rely on abortion as a means to sex select, the reduction in sex ratios documented in this paper is likely driven by increased survival of high birth order girls.

While the main analysis in the paper exploits state-level variation in the timing associated with an increased total level of female leadership within a state, I also investigate if female headship at the district-level Panchayat explains the reduction in high birth order sex ratios in rural areas. I find that the effect is not explained by female headship at the district-level Panchayat, suggesting that female leadership at lower-level Panchayats (the village or the block level) is likely driving the results. Surprisingly, however, I also find that female headship at the district level reduces high birth order sex ratios in the urban population within the district. This is unexpected as the amendment affects local-level government for rural, and not urban, India. I argue that there are reasons to believe that exposure to district-level women leaders is more prominent in urban towns due to the location of district-level offices and media exposure. Consistent with exposure to women leaders being the mechanism, I find that seat reservations for women at the district-level Panchayat decreases the high birth order ratio of boys in areas where exposure to district Panchayat leaders is arguably high, but not in the areas where the Panchayats target their goods and services.","2：While improved enforcement of the ban might succeed in reducing sex ratios, such a policy could have unwanted consequences. Research suggests that in countries with a preference for boys, prenatal sex selection may be a substitute for forms of postnatal discrimination such as infanticide, malnourishment, and an overall lower level of investment in female children (Kalsi, 2015, Lin et al., 2014). Given the issue of substitution across forms of discrimination, policies aimed at reducing the demand for boys by targeting the underlying son preference are preferable to policies that restrict the supply of sex selection technologies. In this paper, I explore whether improving the status of women within society could reduce son preference.

I take advantage of a 1993 amendment to India's constitution, which established a three-tier system of rural governing local bodies (Panchayats) within each state.

Under Pressure: Women’s Leadership during the COVID-19 Crisis,"4：
We find that the presence of a female leader in Brazilian Municipalities had a negative, sizable, and significant impact on the number of COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations per 100 thousand inhabitants. Our results show that electing a woman as a mayor causes a decrease from 46.9 to 51.0 COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100 thousand inhabitants, which represents 30.4 to 33.0 percent of the outcome average among the municipalities that elected a man. Similarly, we document a drop of 21.7 to 25.5 COVID-19 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants decreases in municipalities that elected a woman, around 37.2 to 43.7 percent of the outcome average among the municipalities that elected a man. We also show that electing a female mayor causes a statistically significant in the number of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) enforced in the municipality in 2020. In particular, we show that female leaders are more likely to adopt mandatory use of face masks and forbid gatherings. In contrast, we do not find evidence that women increase investment in health care neither before nor after the pandemic outbreak. Finally, we show that these effects are stronger in municipalities where voters are more supportive of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who openly disavowed vaccines and NPIs during the pandemic. This finding exemplifies the role local leaders can play in counteracting bad policies implemented by populist leaders at the national level.
7：
One possible concern is that mayors’ characteristics that are relevant for policymaking could be driving our results (Alesina et al., 2019). In particular, the fact that female mayors tend to be more educated in Brazilian municipalities could be an issue (Arvate et al., 2017). We show that, in fact, there is a small and non-robust unbalance in both years of education and ideological preferences between female and male leaders. In order to verify if these characteristics are driving our results, we show that our findings do not change after accounting for them in our regressions. This suggests that the difference we document is likely driven by differences in non-observable traits between female and male leaders. We discuss some possible mechanisms in the results section.","6：
Brazil is the ideal setting to understand the role of female leadership during the pandemic for several reasons. First, Brazil was severely hit by the first wave of COVID-19, with considerable variation in deaths and hospitalizations across municipalities (Souza et al., 2020).

Finally, Brazil hosts many competitive local elections, providing statistical power to compare outcomes in mixed-gender close races, as previous works have successfully done.","""1"": ""Political leadership plays a crucial role in shaping social and economic outcomes"",  ""2"": ""The response of leaders around the globe to the COVID-19 crisis varied remarkably"",  ""3"": ""Developing countries like Brazil, Mexico, and India experienced intense and persistent COVID-19 outbreaks"",  ""4"": ""Countries led by women, such as New Zealand, Germany, Taiwan, and Bangladesh, outperformed those led by men"",  ""5"": ""Brazil was severely affected by the first wave of COVID-19, with significant variation in deaths and hospitalizations across municipalities"",  ""6"": ""Brazilian municipalities have considerable autonomy to adopt policies"",  ""7"": ""Brazil has competitive local elections, providing statistical power to compare outcomes in mixed-gender close races"",  ""8"": ""Female empowerment improves social and economic outcomes, but the role of female leadership in global policy issues is not well understood"",  ""9"": ""Little is known about the role of women as policymakers in times of crisis"",  ""10"": ""Previous studies comparing COVID-19 responses in countries ruled by women and men have yielded inconclusive results"",  ""11"": ""The Regression Discontinuity (RD) design is used to identify the effect of electing a female mayor on COVID-19 outcomes"",  ""12"": ""A dynamic local difference-in-difference approach is employed to estimate the effect of electing a female mayor on hospitalizations and deaths caused by SARI"",  ""13"": ""Female mayors in Brazilian municipalities had a negative, sizable, and significant impact on COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations"",  ""14"": ""Female leaders were more likely to adopt non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mandatory use of face masks and restrictions on gatherings"",  ""15"": ""The effects of female leadership were stronger in municipalities where voters were more supportive of the populist president who denied the severity of the crisis"","
Women as decision makers in community forest management: Evidence from Nepal,,"2:
The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether and how an increased participation of women in the decision-making body of local collective action institutions - the Executive Committee (EC) of Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) in Nepal - affects forest protection, specifically the quantity of firewood collected by the households.
3：
Firewood extraction is considered as one of the main causes of deforestation and forest degradation (Baland et al., 2010, 2018; Edmonds, 2002). Therefore, a reduction in the quantity of firewood collected would imply better forest conditions. The hypothesis I want to test is whether a higher female representation in ECs of CFUGs contributes to better forest management and hence to forest protection.
4：
Nepal is a particularly suitable country for this analysis. In 1993 the government of Nepal promulgated a Forest Act which established the transfer of national forests to local communities. Since then Community Forest User Groups (FUGs from now on) have been formed for the management and protection of these forests. These groups can autonomously manage the forests and decide on the distribution of benefits deriving from the forest resources.
5：
The Executive Committee of each FUG plays a critical role in defining the forest products extraction rules and its composition is therefore crucial for the functioning and effectiveness of these institutions. I use two national representative household surveys, the 2004 and 2011 Nepal Living Standard Measurement Surveys, and combine them with a census of all FUGs formed in the country. This is a unique feature of the analysis.
6：
In 2009 an amendment to the Community Forest programme's operational guidelines set at 50 percent the minimum threshold for female representation in the ECs of FUGs. Although the new policy was not legally binding, the new provision actually increased female participation within these local institutions. According to the census of FUGs, in groups formed after 2009 the average percentage of women in the ECs was 44 and 42 for groups formed in 2010 and 2011 respectively. In groups formed before 2010 the average proportion of women in the ECs ranged between 25 and 38 percent.
8：
This study is motivated by the fact that minimal research has been devoted to exploring gender differences within community-based institutions established for natural resources management. However, women are largely responsible for the collection and use of firewood and other forest products within a household. Despite being important stakeholders in forest management, they are often neglected in the decision-making process that sets out the rules to access and collect forest products within a Community Forest (CF). This under-representation together with pre-existing gender inequalities within the household and the society as a whole, poses serious concerns for women who have the primary responsibility for the collection of forest products within the household (Agarwal, 2007).

Can technology improve the classroom experience in primary education? An African experiment on a worldwide program,,"2:
While some attention has been devoted to classical school inputs targeting equally all students in the classroom, these could be inadequate to help strengthening education quality.1 Targeting more and better school inputs to those students lagging behind could be the way to go, namely in settings where student heterogeneity is significant (Banerjee et al., 2007). At the same time, computer technology enabled pedagogical methods to be more tailored to the specific needs of individual students. Many programs have been trying to improve education quality in developing countries through the use of technology. However, experimental evidence from various parts of the world reviewed by Escueta et al. (2017) proves that simply providing schools with computers is unlikely to improve children’s academic performance. Differently, computer hardware combined with Computer-assisted Learning (CAL) software has demonstrated clear positive impacts on student achievement, in particular when individual customization of contents is possible, e.g., Muralidharan et al. (2019). Important questions do however remain about how to link these CAL programs to regular teachers and classroom dynamics. In particular, involving teachers could help a variety of outcomes including decreasing their absenteeism.

The context of our study is the capital city of Luanda, Angola.3 Angola is a suitable illustration of an expanded but low-performing school system. The Gross Enrollment Rate in Angola’s primary education grew from an estimated 71% in 1998 to 113% in 2015. However, in 2014 its youth literacy rate was close to the average of Sub-Saharan African countries, at 77% (World Bank, World Development Indicators, 2019). Sizeable heterogeneity in students’ abilities within each classroom is common.

Long Live friendship? The long-term impact of Soviet aid on Sino-Russian trade,"6:The key finding is that Chinese cities which received more Soviet aid trade more with Russia than with other foreign countries. This result holds in the face of various robustness checks, including using a cross-sectional specification, alternative variable constructions, different matching methods, various sample restrictions, and controlling for city and country-level characteristics. As suggested by our estimates, one additional aid project in a city increases its trade with Russia relative to other countries by 28.9 percent, which translates into 10.5 million dollars in 2002. In addition, we find collaborating evidence that Soviet aid increases the bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) between Russia and China.

8：We provide a rich set of empirical results to support the affinity mechanism.  Exploiting data from the Pew Global Attitudes Survey, we show that respondents in cities with more Soviet aid have a higher affinity toward Russia, agree more with the view that Russia is an ally of China, and agree less that Russia poses a threat to China.  These differences in opinions persist across generations.  We collaborate with the finding by using food preference as an additional proxy for affinity and show that Soviet aid increases the number of restaurants serving Russian cuisine.","2:In this study, we first provide empirical evidence on the long-term impact of aid on international relations. Specifically, we analyze the effect of a prominent aid program in China, the so-called 156 Program supported by the Soviet Union during the 1950s, on contemporary Sino-Russian trade patterns. Next, we offer a new mechanism to explain why the effect exists and persists after decades. The previous theory linking aid and trade relies mainly on the fact that the donor countries exert political influence on the recipients through aid programs to intentionally increase their economic dependence (Richardson, 1976; Roeder, 1985; Alesina and Dollar, 2000). However, since political influence might diminish as soon as aid programs are terminated, it can hardly explain the effects of aid in the long run. Instead, we posit that aid can build social capital, for example, in the form of affinity or trust between donors and recipients, which then facilitates long-term economic exchanges.
7：
Next, we take a step toward understanding why aid continues to increase trade after several decades.   Although a bunch of channels may be relevant, a definitive accounting of the role of each channel is beyond the scope of our study.   Instead, we aim to strengthen a specific interpretation that aid fosters intergroup affinity or trust, which may further facilitate bilateral trade in the long run.   In the spirit of Guiso et al. (2009), trust has important implications on economic exchanges, including bilateral trade, direct investment, and portfolio investment.   Previous studies also find positive effects of bilateral affinity on trade in various contexts (e.g., Disdier and Mayer, 2007;   Michaels and Zhi, 2010).","""1"": ""Foreign aid has been used as a policy lever to improve poor countries' economic and institutional development since World War II."",  ""2"": ""Less is known about how aid programs and their legacies shape international relations, such as economic exchanges and political alliances across countries."","
Colonialism and female empowerment: A two-sided legacy,"5:We present five sets of results. First, we show that the British colonial rule had a two-sided legacy for women that is still visible today. On the one hand, there remains a persistent impact of the historical Anglo-French border on female participation in the labor market. In particular, women in former British territories have a 24 percentage points higher propensity to be in paid employment than their counterparts in former French territories. In terms of magnitude, this is a large effect considering that the mean female paid employment rate throughout the examined region is 62%. Consistent with the British colonizer effect on female employment, we find that women on the British side of the border are also more empowered in terms of control over household resources and property ownership. On the other hand, we estimate that women on the British side of the historical border face a 10 percentage points higher risk of (past year) spousal violence than their counterparts on the French side. Just as the border effect on female paid employment, this effect is large in magnitude as it compares with a mean prevalence of IPV of 28% throughout the region examined. We demonstrate that the magnitude and precision of these estimates are robust to several alternative specifications.

6：Second, we ask if the two colonizer effects on female employment and IPV are explained by the same or two different subsamples of women.  The latter is a possibility as the partition of Cameroon and its later reunification induced a multiplicity of treatments: besides its impact on women's economic opportunities, the identity of the colonizer has likely affected many dimensions of life in Cameroon, some of which might be relevant for domestic violence in isolation. We show that the two separate border effects on female employment and IPV are not explained by two separate subsamples of women, with one subsample driving the employment effect and the other driving the IPV effect, but by the same subsample of women.  In order words, those women who, due to the legacy of British colonial rule, are more likely to be employed are also those who experience an increased likelihood of being victims of IPV.

7:Third, we conduct supplementary analyses to explore some possible explanations for our findings. The result that the British colonial rule caused a persistent increase in both female employment and IPV, and that these two effects are driven by the same subsample of women, is inconsistent with household bargaining models. These models predict that increased economic opportunities for women reduce IPV by leveling the balance of power between partners (Aizer (2010)). By contrast, our results are consistent with theories of male backlash, whereby men resort to violence when their partners’ economic opportunities increase, in order to reinstate a culture of male authority and control over women. Supporting this interpretation, we show that women of the British side of the historical border have a 12 percentage points higher propensity of having a partner who objects to their employment, and that this effect is entirely explained by the subsample of women driving the British colonizer effect on female employment and IPV.

8：Fourth, while the evidence we provide is suggestive of male backlash (i.e., a causal chain from British colonial rule to higher female employment to increased IPV risk), there might be colonizer effects on third factors driving female employment, domestic violence, or both. Thus, we explore observed individual and household level factors that the literature highlights as such potentially important drivers: male employment, male occupation, male alcohol consumption, education, number of children, age, practice of polygamy, and exposure to conflict. Our RD results show that these factors vary smoothly at the historical Anglo-French border.

9：Fifth, a potential concern with the interpretation of our results arises if self-reporting of IPV is affected by women's empowerment and, in our setting, by different colonial practices in the past. It could be argued that empowering women changes their attitudes to gender equality and, hence, increases the likelihood of reporting IPV in their daily lives. Agüero and Frisancho (2017) use an experimental approach based on indirect questioning techniques to assess the extent of truthful IPV reporting in the DHS. They find no evidence of IPV misreporting for low-educated women, but highly educated women appear to underreport IPV victimization. This suggests that, if anything, empowered women—i.e., those who do not fit the typical victim stereotype—face larger disutility of being exposed as victims and therefore underreport IPV. Building on this finding, if IPV reporting of empowered women is a threat to our interpretation of the results, we would expect a positive individual level correlation between IPV and different measures of female empowerment other than employment. Multivariate regressions based on our estimation sample show this not to be the case: there is a negative correlation between domestic violence and a woman's education, which is inconsistent with the notion that IPV reporting increases with a woman's empowerment.","2：We address this question by utilizing a natural experiment of history in Cameroon. At the end of World War I, after three decades as a German colony, the western territories of today's Cameroon were divided between France and the United Kingdom under a League of Nations mandate. The French and British territories were delimited by an arbitrary border, drawn up in Europe, that cut across politically, economically, demographically and geographically homogeneous regions. Historical records provide evidence that French and British colonial practices affected women on the two sides of the border in significantly different ways. Several British colonial policies created new educational and occupational opportunities for women. For example, girls benefited from a protestant education system that aimed at educating both girls and boys, and women gained opportunities to earn cash wages in the export oriented agriculture sector, under the same conditions as their male counterparts. In contrast, the French colonial practice in these domains centered around educating a small administrative elite and investing in the male employment dominated infrastructure sector, to build railways and roads.

Political reservations and women's entrepreneurship in India,"4：Our empirical strategy follows Iyer et al. (2012) by using differences in the timing of the implementation of reservations across Indian states. We conduct a panel analysis at the state-industry level that allows us to exploit this state-level timing variation and differences in traits across industries. Industries are defined at the three-digit level within the manufacturing sector. Empirical results yield a mixed message regarding the extent to which these reforms improved women's participation in the workforce. On one hand, we do not identify that women's employment in manufacturing increased after the implementation of reservations. This limited response is true in both the unorganized and organized sectors, is observed in multiple datasets, and it holds for employment in both female- and male-owned establishments.

5：On the other hand, we find significant evidence that women's entrepreneurship in India increased with the implementation of political reservations. This increase occurs with a state-level timing that follows the implementation of the reservations, and the growth persists even after controlling for contemporaneous male entrepreneurship by state-industry. We also show that the state-level timing of the implementations was not linked to pre-existing differences in entrepreneurship by state, further adding to the plausible exogeneity introduced by Iyer et al. (2012), and that there is no evidence of pre-trends in the age structures of women-owned manufacturing businesses in 1994. We describe below, however, some important limitations in the degree to which we can fully measure pre-trends, with our evidence often being indirect.

7：We further investigate the channels through which this entrepreneurship flourishes. The heightened start of women-owned establishments is concentrated in industrial sectors in which women have traditionally owned establishments. Equally as important, the greater entrepreneurship is mostly concentrated in household-based enterprises, rather than establishments opening as independent facilities.

8：We then discuss the potential channels through which this effect occurs, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence. We do not find much evidence that the entrepreneurship is linked to changes in reporting or to greater access to government-sponsored contracts and business. Likewise, improved financing conditions appear to play a modest role, as the increase in female-owned loan-holding establishments is weaker than the total effect registered and suggests that financing accompanied the increased entry rather than caused it. We then discuss how entry patterns could be consistent with increases at the local level of public goods and infrastructure favored by women (e.g., Besley et al., 2004, Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004a, Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004b, Pande, 2003) or greater aspirations of women towards entrepreneurship (e.g., Beaman et al., 2012). We discuss how these stimuli could have produced the industry patterns observed, to the extent that women entrepreneurs built upon sectors where women have traditionally been active (e.g., Ghani et al., 2013b) and at a household-based scale of operation that was feasible to achieve.","2:This paper contributes to the literature by looking at an underexplored issue of the link between political and economic empowerment. What role, if any, have these political reservations had for women's participation in the workforce? Despite the many positive impacts associated with these reforms, their contributions to promoting women's engagement in the local economy remain uncertain. These relationships are critical for identifying the short- and long-term impact of such policies. Significant empowerment of women in the workforce and as business owners may be the strongest mechanism possible for entrenching and amplifying the positive impacts associated with these political reservations.

3：We consider in particular the role of women in the manufacturing sector from 1994 to 2005. The unorganized sector of Indian manufacturing is comprised of establishments with fewer than 10 employees (or fewer than 20 if the establishment does not use electricity). Our data report gender-based ownership and employment in unorganized manufacturing establishments by state and industry in 1994, 2000 and 2005. The unorganized sector is of particular interest as it has constituted approximately 99% and 80% of total manufacturing establishment counts and employment in India consistently since the early 1990s. We also observe gender-based employment in the organized sector, which is comprised of all plants above the indicated employment thresholds. On the whole, the female ownership share of Indian manufacturing business more than doubled during our period of study: in 1994, female-owned businesses comprised 9% of total manufacturing employment; by 2005, this share had grown tremendously to 19% (Ghani et al., 2013c). Therefore it is of crucial importance to understand more deeply the factors that have contributed to this sharp emergence of female entrepreneurship and business ownership over a relatively short time period.","""1"": ""Political reservations for women in India have been proven to affect many aspects of the economic, political, and social lives of women"",  ""2"": ""The reservations have been linked to greater local investment in infrastructure and related public goods valued by women"",  ""3"": ""The reservations have also been linked to improved perceptions of women by men and greater aspirations for younger women"",  ""4"": ""The reservations have been associated with greater reporting of crimes against women"",  ""5"": ""The available evidence suggests that these effects persist"",  ""6"": ""The implementation of political reservations has contributed to a significant increase in female ownership share of Indian manufacturing businesses"",  ""7"": ""The timing of the implementation of reservations varies across Indian states"",  ""8"": ""The paper uses differences in the timing of the implementation of reservations to identify the impact on women's entrepreneurship"",  ""9"": ""The paper focuses on the role of women in the manufacturing sector from 1994 to 2005"",  ""10"": ""The unorganized sector of Indian manufacturing is of particular interest as it constitutes a large portion of total manufacturing establishments and employment"",  ""11"": ""The paper also considers gender-based employment in the organized sector"",  ""12"": ""The paper finds that women's employment in manufacturing did not increase after the implementation of reservations"",  ""13"": ""However, there is significant evidence that women's entrepreneurship in India increased with the implementation of reservations"",  ""14"": ""The increase in women's entrepreneurship follows the state-level timing of the reservations"",  ""15"": ""The growth in women's entrepreneurship persists even after controlling for contemporaneous male entrepreneurship"","
Exposure to open defecation can account for the Indian enigma of child height,,"2：In particular, people in India are shorter on average than people in sub-Saharan Africa, despite the fact that Indians are also richer on average (Fig. 1). This enduring and important paradox in the literature has been called the “Asian enigma” (Ramalingaswami et al., 1996). India's height deficit relative to Africa is large: it is about two-fifths as large as the average rural-urban height gap in India, and almost one-quarter as large as the average difference in India between children of literate and illiterate mothers. This defecit impacts many people because 19% of births occur in India.

3：Sanitation, when poor, can be a key determinant of human capital in developing countries. This is because germs from feces cause diarrhea and other diseases, which can consume energy and harm the overall nutrition of growing children and of the mothers who nurture them in pregnancy and early life. Medical research indicates that chronic environmental exposure to fecal germs could be an important cause of growth deficits. This paper documents a large and robust gradient between exposure to open defecation and child height. As we show, sanitation can explain international variation in child height that income and other dimensions of development cannot. Our main conclusion is that open defecation can statistically account for much or all of the average height-for-age difference between India and Africa, in the sense that children in India are projected to be taller by at least as much as the gap, if counterfactually exposed to the African distribution of open defecation density.

4：Over one billion people worldwide defecate in the open (meaning without using any toilet or latrine), most of these in India (Coffey and Spears, 2017). For reasons related to the history and endurance of the caste system, sanitation coverage is exceptionally poor in India, a densely populated country where most people1 defecate in the open. This is a much larger prevalence of open defecation than in other countries with similar economic status. Perhaps surprisingly in light of how much open defecation there is, and how different sanitation in India is from sanitation elsewhere, sanitation received little prior attention in economists' wide-ranging investigations of the puzzle of Indian malnutrition and stunting (e.g. Deaton, 2007; Tarozzi, 2008; Jensen, 2012; Panagariya, 2013).","""1"": ""Physical height is a strong and observable correlate of human capital and health, and is a predictor of economic productivity."",  ""2"": ""Differences in economic wealth do not explain international differences in height across developing countries."",  ""3"": ""India is shorter on average than sub-Saharan Africa, despite being richer on average."",  ""4"": ""Sanitation, when poor, can be a key determinant of human capital in developing countries."",  ""5"": ""Exposure to open defecation can explain international variation in child height that income and other dimensions of development cannot."",  ""6"": ""Sanitation coverage is exceptionally poor in India, with a much larger prevalence of open defecation compared to other countries with similar economic status."",  ""7"": ""Reducing open defecation is a policy priority to improve human capital and health in developing countries."""
"The costs of “blue sky”: Environmental regulation, technology upgrading, and labor demand in China","10:We find that the KCAPC policy is effective in terms of reducing SO2 emissions (measured at 26%), mainly by leading to “changes in the production process” rather than “end-of-pipe” treatments or production reduction. Most importantly, our results show that the new environmental regulations have led to significantly lower levels of employment in the manufacturing sector in regulated areas: employment in treatment firms fell by 3% relative to similar firms in nonregulated areas, which is similar to the existing findings on the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments (Greenstone, 2002). These results suggest that a 1% reduction in SO2 emissions will lead to a 0.13% decrease in labor demand. Additionally, we find that low-skilled labor and workers in domestic firms are more likely to lose their jobs under environmental regulation in China.Environmental regulations have also increased labor productivity, which may be due to the effects of improved technology. Using the WTO accession as the external shock, we further prove that technology upgrading could be skill increasing and thus labor-saving.","5:Due to inexpensive labor and laxer environmental regulations, the concept of “Made in China” has been growing dramatically under China's economic transformation and growth since the end of the last century. In recent decades, however, as China has become wealthier and pollution problems have created large dissatisfaction among the public, pollution reduction has become a high priority for the government. In 2014, at the Communist party's annual congress, Premier Li Keqiang declared war on air pollution in China. At the party congress in 2017, he renewed his vow to “make our skies blue again.” As China has published a series of policies and plans aimed at addressing environmental problems, the urgent question to answer is as follows: Who will bear the cost? Unlike developed countries where the cost and benefit analysis has long been considered in the policy design process, policymakers in developing countries such as China have only recently begun to pay attention to the potential costs of environmental policies. With the increasing intensity of environmental governance, China's already heavy burden under which it must constantly create new jobs simply to prevent unemployment from increasing may become even heavier. Therefore, estimating the potential impacts of air pollution control on employment, identifying vulnerable groups, and providing corresponding policy recommendations in China is particularly urgent.","""1"": ""The costs of 'blue sky': Environmental regulation, technology upgrading, and labor demand in China"",  ""2"": ""Balancing environmental protection and economic development is a key issue in policy formulation"",  ""3"": ""Stricter environmental policy may lead to higher production costs and a decrease in labor demand"",  ""4"": ""Previous studies have found mixed evidence on the negative effects of environmental regulation on labor demand"",  ""5"": ""China has become wealthier and pollution reduction has become a high priority for the government"","
Response and adaptation of agriculture to climate change: Evidence from China,"We combine the strength of existing literature to investigate the nonlinear relationship between agricultural TFPs and variation in temperature and other weather variables. This article follows two representative approaches introduced by Schlenker and Roberts (2009) in panel regressions: 1) a simple piecewise linear function of temperature and construct the variables of growing degree days (GDDs) below and above a selected threshold and 2) more specific temperature bins that calculate the accumulation of heat for each 3–6?°C temperature interval.The simultaneous variations in additional weather variables, such as rainfall, sunshine duration, humidity, and wind force are also taken into account (Zhang et al., 2017).Panel estimates suggest that piecewise linear function yields results similar to those estimated using more complicated functional forms. An increase in exposure to temperatures above 33?°C results in sharp declines in agricultural TFPs. We use the same methods to evaluate the impact of climate change on yield (measured by unit land output value) and find it to be more negative than the impact on agricultural TFP, as we expected, since extreme hot weather may also lower input utilization in the short run. Applying the same approach, we find evidence that labor and fertilizer usage is indeed significantly reduced with an increase in exposure to high temperature.
To investigate whether longer-term adjustment to climate change has significantly exceeded shorter-run adjustment, we follow Burke and Emerick (2016) to compare the panel estimates with the long differences estimates. Long-run adaptations appear to have mitigated 37.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3%–54.8%) of the short-run impacts of extreme heat exposure on China’s agricultural TFPs. In terms of yield, 46.8% (95% CI, 30.2%–58.0%) of the short-run effect is offset in the long run, which is larger than the offset in TFP, implying the existence of adaptation in input usage. Comparing the panel estimates with the long differences estimates of inputs, we find that adaptation indeed occurred in all three inputs. The negative impact of climate change in labor and fertilizer is smaller, and a positive effect on machinery is found in the long run, indicating that farmers use more machines to replace labor when the weather gets hotter. This finding provides new evidence for the induced innovation theory proposed by Hayami and Ruttan (1971).
Our findings remained remarkably robust when alternative methods to merge climate and agriculture data, alternative temperature bins, alternative productivity measures, and alternative estimation strategies are adopted. Using the estimated coefficients, together with different future climate change scenarios, we further projected the effect of future warming on China’s agriculture. China’s agricultural TFP is projected to decline by 2–6% by 2050 and by 4–12% by 2070 under the global climate models HadGEM2-ES and NorESM1-M. The decline in agricultural yield is projected to be nearly twice as large as the reduction in agricultural TFP in the future. Although climate adaptation is occurring, future global warming is still expected to make a significant negative effect on China’s agricultural production. This effect is likely to increase in the long term, relative to the midterm. This means that the earlier the mitigation actions are taken, the better the policy effects will be.","6：
This article aims to evaluate the responses and adaptations of agricultural TFPs to climate change in China, which is the largest global emitters and largest developing country boasting the largest agricultural economy and population.  China’s mitigation policy aims at reducing GHG emissions intensity, through industrial structure adjustment, energy consumption structure optimization, energy efficiency improvement, carbon sequestration capacity enhancement, and pilot carbon trading, among others.  By 2017, carbon intensity in China had dropped by about 46% compared with 2005.  In terms of adaptation policies, apart from China’s National Climate Change Programme, we have been unable to find policies at the national level specifically targeting agricultural adaptation to climate change.  However, some other policies, such as the “One Exemption and Three Subsidies” policy,2 are not only designed to ensure food security and increase farmers’ income, but also improve agricultural adaptation to climate change.  This is because they not only encourage innovation and adoption of heat-resistant and drought-resistant species that can reduce productivity loss, but also motivate more investments in agriculture.  Understanding how these policies mitigate agricultural losses in the context of global warming through two channels including productivity and input utilization, is of great significance for developing more effective adaptation policies.  Hence, this article also aims to identify the mechanism by which climate change affects yield through its impact on TFP and input utilization, as well as the mechanism of adaptation behaviors of Chinese farmers.The data used for this study comes from two sources.  On the one hand, a county-year panel data for 2495 counties consisting of specific agricultural inputs and outputs over the period of 1981–2015 is used to construct four agricultural TFP measures under various specifications to rule out the effect of labor, fertilizer and machinery on yield.  On the other hand, comprehensive daily weather records from 820 weather stations are merged to these 2495 counties using the inverse distance weighting method (IDW), which makes it possible to further investigate how inputs and TFPs are affected by climate change.","""1"": ""Mitigation and adaptation are two important tools for reducing the risks of climate change."",  ""2"": ""Agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to rising temperatures and is directly affected by climate change."",  ""3"": ""China is the largest global emitter and the largest developing country with the largest agricultural economy and population."",  ""4"": ""China's mitigation policy aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity."",  ""5"": ""China has implemented policies such as the 'One Exemption and Three Subsidies' policy to improve agricultural adaptation to climate change."",  ""6"": ""Understanding the mechanisms of how climate change affects agriculture and the extent of longer-run adaptation offsets is important for designing better agricultural and climate policies."",  ""7"": ""Previous studies have used cross-sectional variation to examine the relationship between temperature and precipitation with agricultural outcomes across different locations."",  ""8"": ""Panel regression approaches have been used to examine outcomes for a given area under different climatic conditions."",  ""9"": ""Total factor productivity (TFP) is a measure of technological progress and technical efficiency in the agriculture sector."",  ""10"": ""The impact of climate change on TFP and input utilization helps to analyze adaptation behaviors in agricultural production."",  ""11"": ""Most economic analyses on the effects of climate change on agriculture have focused on developed countries, but it is important to study the impacts in developing countries as well."",  ""12"": ""Extreme hot weather may lower input utilization in the short run, resulting in more negative impacts on yield compared to TFP."",  ""13"": ""Long-run adaptations have mitigated a significant portion of the short-run impacts of extreme heat exposure on China's agricultural TFP and yield."",  ""14"": ""Adaptation behaviors have been observed in labor, fertilizer, and machinery usage in response to climate change."",  ""15"": ""Future warming is projected to have a significant negative effect on China's agricultural production, with a larger decline in yield compared to TFP."","
Greening through finance?,"6：
We then employ a difference-in-difference strategy to examine the impact of green credit, conditional on the environmental law compliance status of borrowers, on the loan costs and on firms' economic and environmental performance within the context of a prominent increase in enforcement stringency of the Chinese green credit regulation in 2012. Basically, our baseline results reveal that, after 2012, strengthened green credit regulations explain 10.2% of the increase in the floating ratio of the loan rate for firms with noncompliance records relative to their law-abiding counterparts.3 Later, we demonstrate the robustness of our results by conducting several tests to address potential endogeneity issues. Moreover, we study the heterogeneous effects across different types of firms. We find the effects to be more pronounced for privately owned firms (POEs). Additionally, small firms with records of noncompliance with environmental regulations saw a larger increase in the interest rate after 2012. In addition to the above intensive margin effect, we also find out the extensive margin effect, that is, strengthened green credit regulation impedes non-compliant firms’ access to loan.
7：
Finally, we assess the impact of green credit regulations on firms’ operations and emissions. To better explore the underlying mechanism, we consistently take firm size into account. We find that large punished firms experience a relatively smaller decrease in liabilities, compared with small punished firms. Their total assets, fixed assets, investments, and operational performance, including sales and employees, are also less negatively impacted. However, there is no observable difference pertaining to the impact on profits of firm varied by their sizes. When it comes to the environmental performance, although all of these firms reduced their pollution emissions, how the reductions were realized is dissimilar: large firms place a large proportion of their investment into emission control by, for example, adopting more abatement facilities, while small firms simply choose to produce less. Stated differently, upon the green loan regulations, the large noncompliant firms responsively upgrade pollution cleaning technology thus turning green; while small noncompliant firms are forced to produce less due to less loans with higher costs. In a certain sense, financial markets are able to internalize the potential adverse costs of environmental fines on the margins of a borrowing firm. And it would be seen as a sound complementary mechanism to administrations, especially in countries with limited government capacity.","3：
China's substantially strengthened enforcement of green credit regulations in 2012 further provide an excellent opportunity to identify the causal effect of green credit on firms' external financial conditions through a difference-in-difference strategy. Given the limited regulatory capacity of governments,2 the potential of the financial sector in environmental protection was re-affirmed and substantially enhanced by the Guideline on Green Credit, enacted in February 2012 in China. In contrast to pure market mechanisms spontaneously adopted by banks, such as the Equator Principle, green credit in China features pressures on banks which are obliged to account for environmental risks. Any failure to adhere to the rules might trigger sanctions on banks and are likely to detrimentally impact banks' achievement assessments, which serve as important bases for governmental regulatory ratings of banks, banks' market access and their managers' achievement evaluation. Therefore, echoing Foster and Gutierrez (2013) who find that voluntary certification can provide an important complement to mandatory inspections as a basis for environmental regulation in low-income countries, our investigation on the effect of green credit in the context of China's green credit mechanism also helps to determine the role that financial markets can play, especially in an environment with limited government capacity.","""1"": ""Green credit involves capital allocation under environmental constraints and has been widely developed by banking sectors worldwide."",  ""2"": ""China substantially strengthened enforcement of green credit regulations in 2012 through the Guideline on Green Credit."",  ""3"": ""The green credit regulations in China put pressure on banks to account for environmental risks, with potential sanctions for non-compliance."","
The effects of fuel standards on air pollution: Evidence from China,"8：
The analyses yield several main results. First, the enforcement of more stringent fuel standards significantly improved air quality. The average pollution across all pollutants was reduced by 12.9%. The progression from a lower to a higher standard led to an average fall of 9.4 μg/m3 in the concentration of PM2.5. Reassuringly, the long-run policy effect implied by the RD estimate aligns well with that from the DD estimate. Such improvement points to the importance of fuel standards in mitigating vehicles' environmental adversities.
9：
Second, there are some intra-day fluctuations, but these are well explained by the atmospheric chemistry of the pollutants, ensuring the credibility of the main results. Overall, local governments' environmental protection efforts appear to be an important institutional factor in enhancing the environmental benefits of a higher fuel standard, suggesting their importance in China's decentralized system of environmental governance. The new standards are more effective in cities with more active government pollution reduction efforts.
10：
Third, a back-of-the-envelope analysis further suggests that the net benefit of adopting the new gasoline standard is significant, at US$26 billion annually. Using health-based studies of particulate air pollution from China, the improved air quality generates US$21.44 billion annually in health benefits from reduced mortality and US$8.65 billion annually in health benefits from reduced morbidity. The upgrading involves a cost increase (measured at consumer prices) of about US$3.99 billion.","3：
This study attempts to bridge this gap by documenting novel empirical evidence and measuring the benefits of fuel standards in the largest developing country, China. More precisely, it investigates the relationship between China's fuel standards, which specify lower sulfur content, and levels of air pollution. There are three reasons for this focus. First, China has become the world's largest automobile market. There has been an unprecedented increase in the country's vehicle ownership, shown in Fig. 1. Intensive oil consumption is associated with a large number of externalities (Parry et al., 2007). China's cities rank among the most polluted in the world (World Bank, 2007; Greenstone and Hanna, 2014; Chen et al., 2013; Cropper, 2010). That makes regulating fuel content of great policy relevance. Second, uniform fuel standards have gradually been introduced in Chinese cities, which provides a new opportunity to understand their environmental implications. The different standards together with accurate data allow overcoming methodological obstacles that have impeded progress in this field.
4：
Third, Chinese fuel standards generally follow the practices of Europe, Japan and the United States. Very similar regulations facilitate meaningful international comparisons of policy effectiveness. Apart from the detailed insights into the role of policy in the current setting, some general lessons could emerge which would enrich our view of fuel content regulations in a broader context.","""1"": ""The average air quality in places where 92% of the world's population lives exceeds the World Health Organization's suggested limits for pollutants."",  ""2"": ""Road transport, due to low quality fuel and old vehicles, contributes from 12% to 70% of air pollution in major developing cities."",  ""3"": ""China has become the world's largest automobile market with a significant increase in vehicle ownership."",  ""4"": ""China's cities rank among the most polluted in the world, making fuel content regulation important."",  ""5"": ""China has gradually tightened its gasoline standards since 2013 to reduce emissions from motor vehicles."",  ""6"": ""Data on air pollution levels, including particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and ozone concentrations, are analyzed."","
Labor market impacts and responses: The economic consequences of a marine environmental disaster,"3：We estimate the impact of Formosa by employing a series of difference-in-differences estimations (DiD) using individual-worker data, and show that the disaster sharply reduced average fishery income by as much as 42 percent during the rest of 2016. Utilizing high-resolution, satellite-detected data on the prevalence of night-time fishing boats at the monthly interval, we additionally estimate the direct impact of Formosa on fishing activities, showing an average decline in fishing intensity of as much as 36 percent in the period immediately following the pollution breakout. Importantly, we find a large spatial variation in impact's magnitude. Our estimation indicates a more negative impact on fishery communities located downstream of the contaminated zone relative to those upstream and closer to safe waters. In addition, we show that the heterogeneous impact seems to have induced different labor-market coping responses. Satellite data suggests a strong northward movement in the fishing pattern of the affected upstream fishers. Being able to travel to safer fishing grounds allowed these workers to maintain the number of work hours. In contrast, fishers located downstream were more likely trapped inside the contaminated zone; their average income reduced by more than half in 2016. This adverse circumstance led to a significant reduction in fishery work hours and an increase in the likelihood of working secondary jobs. Quantile analysis further suggests a distributional impact across fishery income groups, indicating the strongest damage to fishers in the lowest income quantile.

4：Next, we study aspects of the disaster recovery by examining Formosa effects on both fishing intensity and fishery earnings over time. We find a gradual reduction in the size of disaster damage to both outcomes. Evidence shows that by the last quarter of 2016, while fishing activity in the affected region had largely recovered, average monthly fishery earnings were still only two-third of the pre-disaster period. Additionally, we examine potential spillover effects of Formosa to other related industries in the affected provinces. Among the industries deemed eligible for Formosa compensation by the government, we find positive earning spillovers to workers in the freshwater-fishery industry, especially those located downstream. Finally, in an extended discussion, we study the potential effect of the government's fishing-ban policy. Evidence from a spatial regression discontinuity design and a triple-differences analysis suggest some, albeit not statistically robust, effect of the ban, which aligns with our view that, rather than being strictly enforced, the ban served more as a mechanism through which the government communicated the severity of the incidence to the public.","2：In this paper, we examine the labor-market impacts of Formosa,1 an industrial marine pollution crisis that took place in Vietnam in April 2016 and disrupted fishery activities in the country's central coast. Our analysis leverages a novel source of high-resolution satellite data on night-time boat detection in Vietnam's marine exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and relates it to employment data from the Vietnamese labor force surveys. Exploiting both the industry-specific and location-specific natures of the Formosa shock, our identification strategy compares fishery workers that lived in the affected region to both non-fishery workers in the same area and other fishery workers outside the affected zone. //研究内容

5：Our paper focuses on evaluating the short-run, immediate impacts of Formosa on fishery workers, and how the affected fishers adapted to this extreme shock to their livelihoods, for at least two important reasons. First, fishery is the third-most dominant sector in Vietnam, accounting for 19.97 percent of the country's total agricultural GDP in 2016 and 9–10 percent total export revenues (General Statistics Office, 2016b). Fishery-related activities also make up a considerable share of the economics in the central Vietnam. At the four-digit Vietnam Standard Industrial Classification (VSIC) level, the single sub-industry of saltwater fishery accounts for 3.8 and 7.3 percent of total employment and income in coastal districts2 of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Hue in 2015 (General Statistics Office, 2016a). Second, the Vietnamese fishery sector is characterized as being predominantly small-scale and concentrated in coastal near-shore waters (Pomeroy et al., 2009).3 Due to this nature of the industry, majority of Vietnamese fishers face considerable restriction on the length and types of their fishing voyage. Fishery earnings are also highly vulnerable to uncertainties in fishing condition—from unfavorable climates to extreme, albeit rare, incidents like Formosa. Because we are interested in examining the immediate impact of the crisis, we confine the scope of the analysis to the period before any formal source of compensation was distributed, i.e., the rest of 2016.4 The time frame of our analysis allows us to cleanly evaluate fishery economic damages and adaptation activities during the most urgent time, thereby providing insights related to the timing, effectiveness, and equality of assistance policies.","""1"": ""Industrial disasters have become more frequent and severe globally, with developing countries being most affected due to lax environmental standards and a desire to attract foreign investment."",  ""2"": ""The Formosa marine pollution crisis in Vietnam disrupted fishery activities in the country's central coast, which is economically significant as the fishery sector accounts for a significant share of agricultural GDP and export revenues."",  ""3"": ""The Vietnamese fishery sector is predominantly small-scale and concentrated in coastal near-shore waters, making it vulnerable to extreme incidents like the Formosa crisis."","
“Storm autocracies”: Islands as natural experiments,"10：Our empirical analysis corroborates our theoretical prediction that storm shocks cause a deterioration in democratic conditions. First, storms reduce the Polity2 measure of democracy in island countries by 4.25 percent in the following year. In a falsification exercise, we fail to find this adverse effect in an average landlocked or coastal country. Second, we estimate that governments restrict political rights following storms, which constitutes a critical mechanism from storms to a reduced level of democracy. This finding is consistent with the endorsement that the majority of citizens give to populist-autocratic leaders around the world. It also accords with milder forms of repression, such as militarization of the disaster response, given that countries are increasingly deploying their military to extend relief and assistance, at home and abroad (Weeks 2007). We also consider coups and national elections as alternative mechanisms but rule them out. Third, we show that disaster aid is likely to play an important role in financing the repression mechanism. Noting that our benchmark results exclude very large island countries such as Australia and Indonesia, our findings are robust to the use of alternative storm measures, controlling for potential spatial biases and other economic and political control variables as well as the “adaptation” effect to storms, and satisfying the parallel trends assumption.","3：The primary objective of this paper is to illuminate how political agents seize a window of opportunity that is a breeding ground for autocracy in the wake of a particular type of shock, namely, major storms. As their frequency and intensity increase geometrically over time, storms constitute a major avenue of change in political conditions. We start with the observation that major natural shocks typically increase pre-existing group disparities and induce political exclusions and societal grievances via their enormous fatalities and overwhelming material destruction. In their aftermath, if governments fail to adequately compensate victims for their losses, survivors may stage protests, exhibit anti-government political behavior, and even launch massive insurgencies.3 Thus, when a disaster with such implications occurs, the government faces a dilemma: either incur the cost of a major disaster relief effort or confront the cost of a possible insurgency, with the consequent possibility of being overthrown. In most cases, the government rightfully deems the latter cost larger, especially if the government itself is not an autocratic one, because such governments cannot effectively fight attempts to overthrow them.

4：Based on this intuition, our stylized dynamic game-theoretic model of citizen–government interactions in the wake of storms yields a unique equilibrium whereby the government opts to deliver to citizens adequate and effective post-disaster relief, as a result of which citizens refrain from insurgency even if the government resorts to autocracy. Consequently, the incumbent government can tighten its grip over the polity by increasing state control in the aftermath of the shock. This means that storms end up provoking autocratic tendencies through a mutually-agreed political repression, generating a specific type of political regime for which we coin the name “storm autocracies”.","""1"": ""The paper examines the variations in the quality of democratic institutions across countries."",  ""2"": ""The recent appearance of authoritarian turning points around the world has magnified the relevance of understanding the root causes of variations in democratic institutions."",  ""3"": ""The paper focuses on how political agents seize a window of opportunity for autocracy in the wake of major storms."",  ""4"": ""Major natural shocks increase pre-existing group disparities and induce political exclusions and societal grievances."",  ""5"": ""The government faces a dilemma in the aftermath of a disaster: either incur the cost of a major disaster relief effort or confront the cost of a possible insurgency."",  ""6"": ""The paper proposes a dynamic game-theoretic model of citizen-government interactions in the wake of storms, resulting in a unique equilibrium where the government delivers post-disaster relief to avoid insurgency."",  ""7"": ""The study uses a generalized difference-in-differences (DID) approach with multiple treatments over time to compare the levels of democracy in island countries with and without storms."",  ""8"": ""The identification strategy relies on the fact that storms are exogenous shocks, striking randomly in terms of timing and intensity."",  ""9"": ""The paper accounts for unobserved heterogeneity by controlling for country-fixed effects, year-fixed effects, and country-specific linear time trends."",  ""10"": ""Empirical analysis shows that storm shocks cause a deterioration in democratic conditions, reducing the level of democracy in island countries."",  ""11"": ""Governments restrict political rights following storms, contributing to the reduced level of democracy."",  ""12"": ""Disaster aid likely plays a role in financing the repression mechanism."",  ""13"": ""The paper contributes to the literature on the effects of exogenous events on political conditions and the influence of natural hazards-driven disasters on the political space."",  ""14"": ""The study highlights an environment in which autocratic perpetuity arises due to natural disasters."",  ""15"": ""The paper focuses on the effects of storms on democratic conditions, contributing to the literature on the economic impacts of natural disasters."","
Trade policy uncertainty and new firm entry: Evidence from China,"3：In this study, we investigate how the TPU reduction associated with China’s WTO accession has affected new firm entry in China. Using firm registration data from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of China (SAIC), we collect panel data between 1998 and 2006 covering 318 prefecture-level cities and 30 two-digit manufacturing industries in China. Following Pierce and Schott (2016), we exploit the TPU variation across industries before and after China’s WTO accession to conduct a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation. Our results show that TPU reduction significantly promotes new firm entry. Specifically, shifting an industry’s TPU reduction from the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile increases its new firm entry rate by 3.31 percentage points, which is around 16.2% of the average annual manufacturing entry rate in our city-industry sample. //研究内容

4：We also shed light on the underlying mechanisms of the effect of TPU on new firm entry. First, a firm entry decision is made by comparing the present value of expected profits and the entry cost. When trade-induced uncertainty is reduced and expected future market conditions improve, potential entrepreneurs may find it profitable to start a new business. The extent of TPU’s impact on firm entry depends on the size and sunkness of the entry cost. Using a set of augmented estimations with triple interactions, we show that the marginal effect of TPU on entry is more pronounced in industries with lower entry barriers. Additionally, uncertainty is most relevant when the input is non-recoupable (Dixit et al., 1994, Folta et al., 2006), thus the impact of uncertainty on entry decisions hinges upon the irreversibility of the investment. Consistent with the literature that emphasizes firms’ wait-and-see strategy under uncertainty (Dixit, 1989, Stokey, 2016), we find that the TPU effect on entry is stronger in industries with larger irreversible investments. Second, export expansion and enhanced market access are likely to be key factors, as it is well documented that TPU reduction has been accompanied by exceptional export growth in China (Handley and Limao, 2017, Feng et al., 2017). We therefore seek to understand the extent to which the growth in new firm entry resulted from the exporting vs. non-exporting margins. Using the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) data, we find that the TPU effect is statistically significant for both exporting and non-exporting entrants, and that the magnitude of the former is 2.38 times that of the latter. Our results thus confirm the importance of export opportunity and market size expansion and point to the possible spillover to domestic non-exporting economic activities. Third, we identify the positive role of TPU reduction on regional agglomeration formation, which can further lower the cost of entry and foster new firm creation in the long run. This mechanism can be particularly important for developing economies in the early stage of industrialization. Last, TPU reduction and export opportunities may decrease entrepreneurial activities through an occupational choice mechanism (Díez and Ozdagli, 2020). As productive incumbent firms expand their production and exporting, labor demand and wage rates are likely to increase, which can discourage individuals from pursuing entrepreneurship. Based on the ASIF data, we find that incumbent Chinese manufacturing firms in high TPU reduction industries indeed experience a relative increase in employment size, but no statistically significant difference in wage rates. We discuss how the lack of an occupational trade-off channel may be attributable to the specific labor market conditions in China during the early 2000s. //机制研究

5：Furthermore, we evaluate the possible regional heterogeneity effects and find that the marginal TPU effect on new firm entry is more pronounced in cities with lower exporting costs or lower entry barriers, illustrating the complementarity between external opportunities and internal reform that has characterized China’s splendid economic performance in the post-WTO era. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that new firm entry plays a non-negligible role in understanding the association between trade and growth. In particular, since the induced entry is primarily attracted by the increase in expected future profits from the US market potentials, we show that the quality of new entrants is relatively higher in industries experiencing larger TPU reduction. Better-performing entrants exert a stronger selection effect by replacing inefficient incumbents and induce a more significant escape-competition effort among incumbents (Asturias et al., 2023, Aghion et al., 2009, Jiang et al., 2021). We report that TPU reduction is associated with more intensified industry-level competition, and that new firm entry can account for around 45% of the TPU-induced incumbent productivity change between 1998 and 2006. //异质性分析","2：One of the key milestones in China’s WTO accession was the establishment of a permanent normal trade relationship (PNTR), or “most favored nation” status, with the United States in October 2000. Prior to that, although China had been receiving temporary normal trade relationship (NTR) treatment since the 1980s and was able to access the US market under the low NTR tariff rates, the situation was plagued with uncertainty, and Chinese exporters were under constant threat of punitive non-NTR tariffs if the temporary NTR status was revoked (Lighthizer, 2010, Handley and Limao, 2015). The end of this trade-related uncertainty has triggered exceptional export growth in China (Pierce and Schott, 2016, Feng et al., 2017) and had wide-ranging economic consequences (e.g., Facchini et al., 2019, Liu and Ma, 2020, Erten and Leight, 2021).","""1"": ""Trade policy uncertainty (TPU) reduction"",  ""2"": ""New firm entry"",  ""3"": ""China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)"",  ""4"": ""Quasi-natural experiment"",  ""5"": ""Difference-in-differences (DID) estimation"",  ""6"": ""International trade and economic growth"",  ""7"": ""Productivity and innovation behaviors among incumbent firms"",  ""8"": ""Entrepreneurial activities and firm entry and exit"",  ""9"": ""Impact of TPU reduction on firm entry decision"",  ""10"": ""Export expansion and market access as key factors"",  ""11"": ""Role of TPU reduction in regional agglomeration formation"",  ""12"": ""Occupational choice mechanism and labor market conditions"",  ""13"": ""Regional heterogeneity effects"",  ""14"": ""Association between trade and growth"",  ""15"": ""Importance of considering the entry margin in welfare quantification"","
Does flattening government improve economic performance? Evidence from China,"7：The analysis yields several main findings. First, the adoption of PMC reforms reduces a county's GDP per capita by an average of 3.9%, which translates into a 0.44% drop in the annual growth rate. These findings indicate that in this context a flattened hierarchy is detrimental to economic performance.

8：Second, both de-jure and de-facto evidence suggests that the PMC reform is mostly a flattening initiative, with the fiscal authority moved from the prefectures to the province. The counties' fiscal revenue and transfers tend to increase after the elimination of the intermediate layer of city government in fiscal management. However, the enlarged span of control for the provincial government has weakened its monitoring and coordination capacity. In particular, total public expenditure and pro-growth investment in PMC counties have declined on average after the reform. More land was sold through negotiation instead of market mechanisms, and at lower prices in the affected counties, pointing to increased land corruption after the PMC reform. This, in turn, may have negatively influenced economic performance. These results demonstrate that such organizational change may well impose costs on the economies concerned that exceed the benefits, and they may also have implications for the design of an effective and productive organization.

Reassuringly, a negative and significant effect on consumption suggests that PMC reform does not in general improve social welfare.","3：Improving the economic development of counties has become a priority for policy makers in China because of its large county-level population and concerns about rural poverty and inequality. On 72% of the Chinese territory, counties directly administer 70% of the total population and yet generate only 37% of the national gross domestic product (GDP).1 Against this background, the PMC flattening reform we evaluate aims to relieve financial strain on county-level governments, improve administrative efficiency, and stimulate local economic growth.","""1"": ""The PMC reform aims to relieve financial strain on county-level governments, improve administrative efficiency, and stimulate local economic growth."",  ""2"": ""72% of the Chinese territory is administered by counties, which directly administer 70% of the total population and generate only 37% of the national GDP."",  ""3"": ""The PMC reform involves the removal of one layer in the fiscal hierarchy, with authority moved from prefectures to provinces."",  ""4"": ""The PMC reform leads to an increase in fiscal revenue and transfers for counties, but a decline in total public expenditure and pro-growth investment."",  ""5"": ""The PMC reform results in increased land corruption and lower land prices in affected counties."",  ""6"": ""The PMC reform does not have significant effects on household income or income inequality."",  ""7"": ""The PMC reform does not generally improve social welfare, as indicated by a negative and significant effect on consumption."""
On the road: Access to transportation infrastructure and economic growth in China,"7：The results show that being close to the line had a positive level effect. Per capita GDP was higher in places closer to the line. However, the effect is not large. The elasticity of per capita GDP with respect to distance from historical transportation networks is approximately ?0.07. The small level effect is consistent with independent data from a higher-quality household survey for rural areas, the National Fixed Point Survey (NFS) collected by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, which shows that distance has no significant effect on household income. For the estimates of the effect of proximity on growth, we find a precisely estimated zero effect. The estimated elasticity between distance to the line and annual per capita GDP growth is ?0.002 and statistically insignificant (the standard error is 0.003). Places close to the line grew exactly as fast as places further away.

8：Our finding that better access to transportation networks does not have a large impact on the (relative) economic performance of those areas is consistent with the Fogelian view that transportation infrastructure by itself does not contribute much to growth, excepting perhaps where there was already a demand for it. Based on similar logic, China scholars have criticized the tremendous amount of public investment in domestic transportation infrastructure after 1990 (Huang, 2008).

9：In assessing what general lessons one can learn from our results, one should consider whether our results are driven by conditions specific to the Chinese context. For example, one may be concerned that the marginal effect of access to infrastructure is especially low in China due to the massive public investment in infrastructure during recent years.3 We believe that this is highly unlikely to be driving our results because our data show large variation in access to infrastructure. The distance to the railroad for the counties that are the nearest the line (defined as the nearest decile) are only one-third of the distance of those furthest (defined as the furthest decile) from the line. Similarly, the nearest counties have more than twice the length of highway relative to the furthest counties (despite the fact that the latter are almost eight times as large). //局限性

10：Another concern for external validity is that the lack of factor mobility stems from the Chinese government's attempts to control labor mobility and that the empirical findings are not easily generalizable to the context of other developing countries.4 We acknowledge that the Chinese government may be unique in implementing an explicit policy for controlling migration for so long. However, it is important to note that the actual patterns of low levels of migration are not unique to China. In particular, the main policy effort has focused on unskilled low-wage rural workers (Meng, 2005), a group that has been found to be relatively immobile in other contexts such as in India (Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2009). Moreover, our simple theory predicts similar effects regardless of which factor (e.g., labor, capital) is immobile and the immobility of capital has been documented in several developing country contexts. For example, Chan et al. (2011) documents the immobility of capital in China during the period of our study. //局限性","2：Second, policymakers are typically concerned about the distributional effects of infrastructure, which are by no means obvious. On the one hand, for fixed factor endowments, the increased access to markets and ideas should benefit all regions. For example, in the historical context of the United States, it has been argued that transportation infrastructure gives rise to more cities, which then turned into “engines” of growth for the country as a whole.1 On the other hand, transportation infrastructure increases the access of rural regions to cities, and the well-known agglomeration effects of cities may cause productive capital and skilled labor to move from rural regions to cities over time, with the result that those who remain in rural areas receive very limited benefits from urbanization or even become impoverished. Along similar lines, it has been argued that the expansion of motor road networks in the United States promoted large-scale suburbanization and left many cities without a viable economic model (Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2009).","""1"": ""Transportation infrastructure is often mentioned as a key to promoting growth and development."",  ""2"": ""Policymakers must consider the question of causality: is infrastructure development a worthwhile object of policy?"","
Intergenerational mobility around the world: A new database,"We obtain the following empirical findings. First, for the youngest cohort born between 1980 and 1989, intergenerational mobility is lower in the average developing country when compared to the average high-income country. This observation holds true for all six measures of mobility. Second, we observe a convergence in mobility when using measures that are sensitive to changes in education inequality across generations (inequality-sensitive measures), but a divergence in mobility when using measures that are invariant to changes in inequality (inequality-invariant measures) are used.

Third, regarding the relationship between intergenerational mobility and national income, we similarly observe two distinct patterns. Inequality-sensitive measures of mobility show a monotonically increasing relationship, while inequality-invariant measures show a U-shape-pattern with high levels of mobility observed among the richest as well as the poorest countries (arguably for different reasons).4 Fourth, Sub-Saharan Africa stands out as a region where children have been least successful at surpassing their parents' education, despite the comparatively low levels of parental education. In the poorest countries, the scope for surpassing parents is greatest but the capacity to educate children is lowest. By contrast, in the world's richest countries, the capacity to educate children is greatest but the scope to surpass parents is lowest. In other words, for two individuals with the same parental education background, it greatly matters what country one is born into, which sits well with Milanovic (2015).

Fifth, the world as a whole is notably less mobile than the average country in it. This underscores the importance of the country in which one obtains his/her education. We furthermore observe a modest upward trend in global mobility measured by inequality-sensitive indicators, while global mobility measured by inequality-invariant indicators is more stagnant. This empirical pattern is consistent with a decline in global inequality over time (Lakner and Milanovic, 2016). Sixth, when intergenerational mobility is disaggregated by gender, girls are found to be catching up to boys in the average developing country. Girls have already overtaken boys in the average high-income country for selected measures of intergenerational mobility and if current time-trends prevail, girls are on track for also surpassing boys in the developing world in the coming decade(s).","A first large cross-sectional database of IGM was compiled by Chetty et al. (2014) which offers estimates of income mobility for 741 subnational regions of the United States. Corak (2021) and Connolly et al. (2021) obtain similarly disaggregated estimates of income mobility for Canada. This made it possible to characterize the variation in intergenerational mobility, establish how large differences in IGM can get, and build an understanding of what the determinants of IGM are. The subnational regions with comparatively high rates of mobility are found to be less residentially segregated, have lower inequality, higher quality public school systems, stronger social networks, and stronger family structures.

TV in times of political uncertainty: Evidence from the 2017 elections in Kenya,"First, I find no evidence that exposure to the signal changed voters’ likelihood of turning out in the first election — i.e. in normal times. However, it had a sizable impact on the repeat election. Based on the stark political divides across the territory, which largely interact with ethnic belongings (Horowitz and Long, 2016), I split the sample between polling centers that voted in favor of the opposition or the incumbent President in 2013. Strikingly, the sign of the estimates is opposite in the two political camps. In pro-opposition polling centers, moving from an area without TV to an area with TV lowers participation by 4 percentage points. Conversely, I find that TV has a positive and large effect on remobilization, ＋7 percentage points, among supporters of the incumbent and final winner of the election. Moreover, as the incumbent’s win margin in the previous poll increases, the effect of signal reception grows larger. The estimates suggest that a 10-percent increase in the incumbent’s score adds 1.5 percentage points to the baseline coefficient.

Turning to the possible impact of exposure to TV on involvement in the electoral protests, I find that it has no effect on average, but tend to decrease slightly the probability of conflict in the surroundings of pro-incumbent’s polling centers. Yet, I find no effect at the intensive margin, that this to say on the number of demonstrations.

These findings are corroborated with a series of robustness checks. The results are similar when the sample is restricted to areas that got access to the signal after 2016, which suggests that they are not driven by more urbanized places. This also indicates that the treatment effect is not contaminated by the larger penetration of the Internet and social media in bigger cities – in rural areas in 2016, 77% of the population never get access to news through the Internet (Afrobarometer) –, nor by the higher likelihood to be directly exposed to urban riots.2 Moreover, a placebo test confirms that the results are not spurious as I find no effect of being granted access to the signal in 2018, i.e. just after the 2017 election on mobilization.

In the last part of the paper, I delve into the potential channels of transmission and investigate various mechanisms that could account for the difference between the August and October elections, as well as the opposite effects in the two political camps. I argue that television played a predominantly informative role leading up to the repeat election. Given the unexpected decision by the Supreme Court and the exceptional circumstances surrounding it, voters required clear and comprehensive information to grasp the unfolding events and the need for a subsequent vote. Employing text analysis tools, I examine the content of news bulletins from the five most popular Kenyan channels and provide an overview of the TV coverage in 2017 and at the time of the repeat election. The analysis reveals a notable emphasis on the election, especially in the vocabulary employed, as well as a decline in the diversity of news topics covered, suggesting a significant focus on the prevailing context. Additionally, I document that the content heavily focused on protests and the climate of crisis. By comparing the impact of television exposure alongside physical proximity to the protests, I find no exacerbating effect of being in close proximity to demonstrations. Furthermore, exposure to protests without television does not significantly influence turnout, implying that the effect of television was primarily to disseminate information regarding the scheduling of the repeat election.

Furthermore, I explore the potential variations in editorial choices among different channels. This undertaking poses challenges due to the lack of reliable data on audience and viewership in Kenya. Computing the cosine similarity index between pairs of TV centers, I find that channels exhibited distinct editorial stances in 2016, i.e. prior to the start of the electoral season. However, in 2017, the cosine similarity matrix suggests a convergence among the channels, thereby reinforcing the notion of increased emphasis on the election. However, the state-owned station KBC TV stands out as the most distinct channel compared to others, and this distinctiveness appears to be even more pronounced in the four weeks preceding the repeat election. Based on the assumption that pro-government voters may be more inclined to watch this channel, it is plausible that they have been exposed to the incumbent’s call for remobilization and have shown their trust in their leader through this channel.

Last, TV’s collective dimension in Kenya may help explain the observed effect of media exposure. Limited ownership of TV sets leads people to rely on public places like cafes and restaurants to watch news broadcasts. This assumption suggests that TV viewing is a social experience, which could contribute to the consolidation of social coordination mechanisms. In line with this assumption, I find a positive a correlation between the availability of TV signal and the likelihood of individuals frequenting restaurants or cafes, after considering household characteristics and regional fixed-effects. These correlations provide descriptive evidence of the potential link between TV exposure in public places and collective behavior.","In this paper, I compare two elections that took place in a three-month window to investigate how political context influences voters’ choices. More precisely, I focus on a specific case study: the electoral crisis that occurred in Kenya in 2017, which pitted the incumbent President against the leader of the opposition in the race for the presidential mandate. The presidential election took place in August 2017 and resulted in a victory for the incumbent. However, the Supreme Court decided to nullify the election result and ordered the electoral commission to schedule a repeat ballot.1 The ruling marked a breakthrough in Kenyan politics, and the debate around the nullification and the organization of new polls was accompanied by with a wave of opposition-led protests. While the first election was organized in a normal electoral context, the legal dispute and the riots dramatically fed a climate of crisis throughout the country. The level of political uncertainty, measured for example, by the World Uncertainty Index, rose sharply before the repeat election and reached its highest level for ten years.",
Evaluating the impact of general versus vocational education on labor market outcomes in Egypt by means of a regression discontinuity design,"The results suggest that male upper-secondary general education graduates aged 25–49 experience no advantage in terms of employment probability compared to vocational education graduates. Often, young men in developing countries cannot afford not to work (Fields, 2004), which also holds true in our sample, where approximately 90% of the observed men are employed independent of their highest education degree.7 However, a high level of employment alone is no guarantee of being able to make a living from it. Especially in countries with a large informal sector, such as Egypt, it is also important to account for the quality of employment.8 We do so using wages for those in wage employment. Wages are a central measure of employment quality contributing directly to workers’ material well-being (Cazes et al., 2015). In addition, we account for employment quality by using two measures for formal employment, namely, public sector and formal private sector employment, which are often associated with good working conditions and wages (Assaad, 1997, Krafft and Assaad, 2015, World Bank, 2014). We find that, conditional on wage employment, male general upper-secondary education graduates do not earn higher wages than vocational education graduates. This result likely reflects the low power of the first stage in the sample of male wage-earning upper-secondary graduates. Regarding job formality, we show that among employed male upper-secondary education graduates, general graduates are not more likely to have a public sector job. In contrast, conditional on private sector employment, male upper-secondary general education graduates are more likely to have formal jobs. Given this finding, it is surprising that our results do not suggest higher wages for general upper-secondary graduates, as formal private-sector jobs in developing countries are often associated with high productivity levels and high wages (Günther and Launov, 2012, La Porta and Shleifer, 2008). However, crony capitalism may limit the productivity of formal private-sector jobs in Egypt (Chekir and Diwan, 2014). Moreover, formal private sector jobs offer job security, and benefits such paid sick leave (World Bank, 2014).9 An analysis by age shows no statistically significant differences in the short or long term for any of the four outcomes, which is in contrast to the results of other studies in this area. (e.g. Hanushek et al., 2017, Brunello and Rocco, 2017). We confirm these findings through several robustness checks. Our findings on employment and wages are in line with some studies that demonstrate a neutral long-term effect, while our finding of a relative advantage of general education in terms of job quality contradicts the rest of the literature, where employment quality is often measured in terms of wages. The reasons for this difference could be the relatively low quality of vocational education in Egypt, low permeability of Egypt’s education system (Assaad, 2010, Krafft, 2018), or lack of work-based training. Involving the business sector could improve the labor market outcomes of vocational upper-secondary graduates (Bolli et al., 2021).","A common view in the literature is that vocational education has a short-term advantage over general education as it provides for relatively quicker and smoother labor market integration (Hanushek et al., 2017). However, in the long term, vocational skills may become obsolete relatively quickly, lowering labor market attachment, labor market mobility, and earning options (Blundell et al., 1999, Acemoglu and Pischke, 1999, Muehlemann and Wolter, 2020). In addition, vocational education may not grant equal access to higher education, where general education does. In developing countries, quality differences between vocational and general education tracks, the lower permeability of education systems, and the scarcity of formal jobs for which vocational and general education graduates compete may further influence the trade-off between vocational and general education.","""1"": ""Vocational education has become an important topic on the agenda of policymakers to provide the youth with a valid alternative to university education."",  ""2"": ""Vocational education is seen to have a short-term advantage over general education in terms of labor market integration."",  ""3"": ""Vocational skills may become obsolete in the long term, leading to lower labor market attachment, mobility, and earning options."",  ""4"": ""Vocational education may not grant equal access to higher education compared to general education."",  ""5"": ""Quality differences between vocational and general education tracks, lower permeability of education systems, and scarcity of formal jobs may influence the trade-off between vocational and general education."",  ""6"": ""Limited experimental or quasi-experimental studies have evaluated the causal impact of vocational versus general education on labor market outcomes, with most focusing on developed countries."",  ""7"": ""Existing evidence suggests a short- to medium-term advantage of vocational education over general education in developed countries, but the long-term impact is neutral to positive."",  ""8"": ""Experimental and quasi-experimental studies in the US indicate a positive short- to medium-term impact of vocational education on labor market outcomes."",  ""9"": ""Studies using difference-in-differences estimation or regression discontinuity designs do not indicate a relative advantage of vocational education in the long term, except for one study."",  ""10"": ""Only two quasi-experimental studies exist in the context of developing countries, both using an instrumental variable approach."",  ""11"": ""The current study applies a regression discontinuity design based on test scores to evaluate the causal impact of general versus vocational education in Egypt."",  ""12"": ""The study is the first to apply this identification strategy in a developing country."",  ""13"": ""The study estimates the long-term impacts of general versus vocational education approximately 17 years after program exit."",  ""14"": ""The study evaluates the impact of general versus vocational education on employment probability, wages, public-sector employment, and formal employment in the private sector."",  ""15"": ""The study focuses on male upper-secondary education graduates aged 25-49 in Egypt."","
Illegal markets and contemporary slavery: Evidence from the mahogany trade in the Amazon,,"There are two primary reasons why illegal markets are more prone to the use of slave labor than legal ones. Firstly, it is virtually impossible for an agent in the illegal market to formally employ anyone. As a result, agents resort to informal labor, where there are no institutions mediating employer–employee relationships; this is particularly true in rural, poor, and isolated sites, where workers generally have little bargaining power to set favorable work conditions. Secondly, modern slavery often involves violence and life threats, where perpetrators hold enslaved individuals as prisoners (Sakamoto, 2006). This is supported by empirical evidence, such as Chimeli and Soares (2017), which found that the shutdown of the mahogany market increased homicides. Additionally, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence which indicates how violence is used in the illegal mahogany market, with loggers having access to illegal weapons and frequently threatening those who resist the logging. Therefore, the cost of committing further crimes is much lower in an illegal and unregulated market than in a legal one.","""1"": ""The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights declared that 'slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms'"",  ""2"": ""An estimated 49.7 million people were living in modern slavery in 2022, with 27.7 million in forced labor"",  ""3"": ""Workers in illegal markets, such as lumber mills and charcoal mines, are often in vulnerable positions and recruited from disadvantaged regions"",  ""4"": ""Illegal markets involve the use of violence and provide less security for workers"",  ""5"": ""Limited empirical evidence exists on how market illegality affects workplace relations and forced labor"""
Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets,"Using this strategy, we estimate a negative relationship between a commuting zone’s exposure to robots and its post-1990 labor market outcomes. Our estimates imply that between 1990 and 2007 the increase in the stock of robots (approximately one additional robot per thousand workers from 1993 to 2007) reduced the average employment-to-population ratio in a commuting zone by 0.39 percentage points and average wages by 0.77% (relative to a commuting zone with no exposure to robots). These estimates are sizable but not implausible. For example, they imply that one more robot in a commuting zone reduces employment by about six workers; this estimate includes both direct and indirect effects, the latter caused by the decline in the demand for nontradables as a result of reduced employment and wages in the local economy. To understand the aggregate implications of these estimates, we need to make additional assumptions about how different commuting zones interact. Greater use of robots in a commuting zone generates benefits for the rest of the US economy by reducing the prices of tradable goods produced using robots and by creating shared capital income gains. Our model enables us to quantify these positive spillovers across commuting zones and leads to smaller but still negative aggregate effects. With our preferred specification, our estimates imply that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the aggregate employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percentage points and wages by about 0.42% (compared with its larger local effects, 0.39 percentage points and 0.77%, respectively), or equivalently, one new robot reduces employment by about 3.3 workers. We verify that our measure of exposure to robots is unrelated to past trends in employment and wages from 1970 to 1990, a period that preceded the onset of rapid advances in robotics technology. Several robustness checks further bolster our interpretation. First, our results are robust to including differential trends by various baseline characteristics, linear commuting zone trends, and controls for other changes affecting demand or productivity in various industries. Second, we show that the automotive industry, which is the most robot-intensive sector, is not driving our results. Third, consistent with our theoretical emphasis that robots (and more generally, automation technologies) have very different labor market effects than other types of machinery and overall capital deepening, we find no negative employment and wage effects from capital, other IT technologies, or overall productivity increases. The employment effects of robots are most pronounced in manufacturing and particularly in industries most exposed to robots. They are also concentrated in routine manual, blue-collar, assembly, and related occupations. Consistent with the presence of spillovers on nontradables, we estimate negative effects on construction and retail as well as personal services.","Robotics technology advanced significantly in the 1990s and 2000s, leading to a fourfold rise in the stock of (industrial) robots in the United States and western Europe between 1993 and 2007. As figure 1 shows, the increase amounted to one new robot per thousand workers in the United States and 1.6 new robots per thousand workers in western Europe. The automotive industry employs 38% of existing robots, followed by the electronics industry (15%), plastics and chemicals (10%), and metal products (7%).","""1"": ""The identification strategy is based on the measure of exposure to robots in local labor markets"",  ""2"": ""The measure of exposure is constructed using data on the increase in robot usage across industries and their baseline employment shares"",  ""3"": ""The authors exploit adoption trends in European economies to focus on the component of investment in robots driven by technological advances"",  ""4"": ""The assumption is that commuting zones with greater advances in robotics technology are not differentially affected by other labor market shocks or trends"","
"Top earnings inequality and the gender pay gap: Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom","Our findings indicate that the under-representation of women in top income groups accounts for a substantial share, often a majority share, of the gender pay gap in annual earnings in the three countries under study. In light of these findings, we discuss the public policies and private sector initiatives likely to be most effective in improving the under-representation of women among top earners. For that purpose, we extend our analysis beyond the three countries of interest above and consider a set of forty countries for which information on the percentage of women on corporate boards is available over several years.","Interestingly, countries with the largest increases in top income shares are also countries that have among the highest rates of female labour force participation as shown in Fig. 1. For more than 20 years, women have represented more than 45% of the labour force.1 These countries thus have a long standing tradition of high female labour force participation. One would think that this would have opened opportunities for women to advance in career ladders. Yet, the numbers celebrated in terms of the percentage of women on British boards (FTSE 100) in 2015 were around 25% (Davies, 2015). In Canada, that percentage was about 21% for companies on the S & P/ TSX 60 index in 2014 (CSA, 2015).

Did the minimum wage reduce the gender wage gap in Germany,"We are able to identify a significant effect on the wage gap at the regional level, especially for low-paid employees. Between 2014 and 2018, the gap at the 10th percentile was reduced by 4.6 percentage points (or 32%) in regions that were strongly affected by the minimum wage compared to less affected regions. For the gap at the 25th percentile, the effect still amounted to 18%, while for the mean it was smaller (11%) and not particularly robust. Using a continuous bite measure, we can show that an increase in a region’s bite by ten percentage points, reduces the wage at the 10th percentile by 3.3 percentage points. This thus shows that the minimum wage reform led to a significant decrease in the wage gap especially at the bottom of the wage distribution.","In this context, Germany poses an interesting case study. On the one hand, it is a country with a relatively high gender wage gap, especially at the bottom of the wage distribution. In 2014, the difference between the earnings of full-time employed men and full-time employed women amounted to 17.2 percent in Germany, placing it in the upper third of countries with the highest gaps, above the OECD average (see Fig. 1a).2 At the first decile of the wage distribution, Germany even shows a wage difference of 18.2% in 2014, placing it among the eight countries with the highest gaps among low-income earners, and well above the United States and the United Kingdom (see Fig. 1b). It is thus evident that Germany suffers from high gender wage discrepancies in an OECD comparison, especially among low-wage earners.3 On the other hand, Germany introduced a nationwide minimum wage in 2015, which was set at a comparably high level and had only few exemptions.4 With € 8.50 gross per hour, it ranked among the highest wage floors in Europe in terms of purchasing power (Caliendo et al., 2019). Its level is to be re-evaluated every two years, and it was increased to € 8.84 in January 2017, being followed by additional increases in 2019 and the subsequent years (Mindestlohnkommission, Mindestlohnkommission, Mindestlohnkommission). Caused by its high initial value, the reform affected about four million employees, i.e. about ten percent of the eligible workers (Destatis, 2016). Among them, women were vastly overrepresented, since they accounted for two-thirds of affected employees (Burauel, Caliendo, Fedorets, Grabka, Schr?der, Schupp, Wittbrodt, 2017, Mindestlohnkommission). This has been attributed to insufficient regulations of the low-pay sector and gender segregation, which lead to an unequal coverage of collective bargaining agreements for men and women (Grimshaw, Rubery, 2013, Herzog-Stein, Lübker, Pusch, Schulten, Watt, 2018). Accordingly, the introduction of the wage floor could have an influence on gender inequality. In a simulation study, Boll et al. (2015) predict that in the absence of job losses, the minimum wage could reduce the average gender wage gap in Germany by 2.5 percentage points; and with job losses, the effect could even be larger. This points to a potential caveat, namely that low-paid women quitting or losing their jobs could cause a decrease in the gap. However, since all ex-post evaluation studies find only small employment effects and no strong evidence of gender-specific job-losses (see, e.g., Bonin, Isphording, Krause, Lichter, Pestel, Rinne, Caliendo, Obst, Preuss, Schr?der, Grabka, Caliendo, Schr?der, Wittbrodt, 2019, Pestel, Bonin, Isphording, Gregory, Caliendo), this does not seem to be an issue in Germany.","""1"": ""The gender wage gap in Germany is relatively high, especially at the bottom of the wage distribution."",  ""2"": ""Germany introduced a nationwide minimum wage in 2015, which had a high initial value and affected about four million employees, with women being overrepresented among the affected employees."",  ""3"": ""The introduction of the minimum wage in Germany could potentially reduce gender inequality and the gender wage gap."",  ""4"": ""Simulation studies predict that the minimum wage could reduce the average gender wage gap in Germany by 2.5 percentage points."",  ""5"": ""Ex-post evaluation studies find no strong evidence of gender-specific job losses due to the minimum wage introduction in Germany."",  ""6"": ""The analysis uses data from the Structure of Earnings Survey (SES) in 2014 and 2018, which provides detailed wage information for over one million employees."","
Earnings inequality and working hours mismatch,"To preview our results, earnings inequality in terms of the MLD increases significantly from 0.19 to 0.29 during the post-unification and Hartz reforms periods and plateaus at a high level thereafter. The MLD decomposition reveals that only 10% of the increase in earnings inequality result from rising wage inequalities, but that rising working hours inequalities and especially the increasing covariance between working hours and wages play the predominant role. Since the 2000s, in contrast to earlier years, low wages are more often connected to low working hours. This changing pattern turns out to be the main driver of rising earnings inequality in Germany. With regard to the changing composition of the work force, rising wage inequality among male service sector employees is the most important contributor to increased inequality in hourly wages. Increasing inequality in hours can be fully attributed to rising working hours inequality among male and female service sector employees. These two subgroups are also responsible for the increased covariance between hours and wages.

Turning to the counterfactual earnings distribution, we also find an increase in earnings inequality, which mostly occurs in the post-unification and the Hartz reforms period. However, this increase is only about half the size of what is observed for the actual earnings distribution, with the MLD of counterfactual earnings increasing from 0.20 to 0.25. The MLD decomposition reveals that the attenuated increase in counterfactual earnings inequality is due to lower growth in the contributing factors of hours inequality and the covariance. The differences of inequalities in counterfactual and actual earnings are most pronounced—and rising—among female service sector employees. Here, inequality in counterfactual earnings and its three components remain constant over time. In other words, the inability to realize optimal working hours—particularly in the growing group of female service sector employees—contributes significantly to rising earnings inequality.

Our study also reveals changes in patterns of mismatch between desired and actual working hours. The share of overemployed people, those who work more hours than they would prefer, increases by seven percentage points among employees in the top quintile of hourly wages. At the same time, the share of underemployed people, those who prefer longer working hours, almost triples among employees in the bottom quintile. Additionally, we find increasing shares of underemployment among male and female employees in the service sector. These results also hold true after controlling for a broad set of control variables in multivariate regressions. Moreover, the regressions reveal that children are a major statistical explanation for underemployment among women, but not among men. This contradicts the notion that reduced working hours among mothers fully reflect their own choices and preferences.","Germany is a particularly interesting context in which to investigate the connection between working hours mismatch and earnings inequality. We focus on developments in four key periods (see Fig. 1). First, after reunification, Germany experienced a phase of rising unemployment, particularly in the East (Snower and Merkl, 2006). Second, to fight persistently high unemployment, Germany introduced the Hartz labor market reforms5 between 2003 and 2005. In the years that followed, unemployment decreased markedly and the percentage of marginally employed people increased sharply (Fahr, Sunde, 2009, Jacobi, Kluve, 2007). Third, in contrast to many other countries, Germany showed a positive development in employment even within and after the Great Recession, which has been referred to as the “German labor market miracle” (Burda and Hunt, 2011). Fourth, a statutory minimum wage was introduced in 2015, which targeted between 10 and 14% of German employees and affected both wages and working hours6 (Caliendo et al., 2019). We structure our results around the four periods outlined above: post-unification (1993–2002), Hartz reforms (2003–2007), post-recession (2008–2014), minimum wage (2015–2018).",
Defensive Investments and the Demand for Air Quality: Evidence from the NOx Budget Program,"5.
The empirical analysis produces several key results. First, there was a substantial decline in air pollution emissions and ambient concentrations. Figure 1 illustrates the dramatic effect of this market on NOx emissions in the states participating in the NBP.2 In 2001–2002, daily NOx emissions were fairly flat throughout the calendar year, with a peak in summer. In 2005–2007, NOx emissions were nearly 40?percent lower but almost entirely during the summer months when the NBP was in force. NOx emissions are a primary ingredient in the complex function that produces ozone air pollution, so it is unsurprising that we find that the large reductions in NOx led to declines in mean ozone concentrations of roughly 6 percent and reduced the number of summer days with high ozone levels (i.e., more than 65 ppb) by about 35 percent, or a third of a standard deviation.                                               6.
Second, these improvements in air quality produced substantial benefits.  Medication expenditures decreased by about 1.6 percent or roughly $800 million  annually in the 19 eastern and midwestern United States where the NBP was in  force; this is close to an upper bound estimate of the NBP’s total abatement costs.  This decline in medication expenditures is evident both among short-acting respiratory medications taken in response to the presentation of respiratory symptoms  and long-term control medications that are taken to prevent these episodes. Since  people can engage in other defensive investments like avoiding time outdoors or  purchasing air filters, medication expenditures provide a lower bound on the total  defensive costs associated with air pollution. Further, the summertime mortality rate  declined by up to 0.4 percent, corresponding to 1,975 fewer premature deaths per  summer in the NBP states, mainly among individuals 75 and older. The application  of age-adjusted estimates of the value of a statistical life (Murphy and Topel 2006) implies this reduced mortality is valued at about $1.3 billion annually. The mortality  estimates are less precise than the medication ones, and the results must be interpreted accordingly. Additionally, there is little systematic evidence of an effect of the NBP on hospitalization charges. Overall, it is striking that defensive investments  account for more than one-third of our estimate of total WTP for reductions in NOx emissions.    
7. 
Third, the paper provides the first instrumental variables estimates of the effect of NOx emissions on health and defensive investments. Such information is an essential determinant of air quality policy since NOx is a pollutant that can be controlled directly by regulation, whereas ozone cannot be. Ambient ozone is determined by a complex function based on several factors including NOx emissions, volatile organic compound emissions (VOCs), and temperature. These estimates suggest a significant causal link between NOx emissions, medication purchases, and mortality. For example, we find that a 10 percentage point (pp) reduction in NOx emissions leads to 0.06 to 0.011 pp reduction in medication purchases and also an 0.04 to 0.07 pp reduction in mortality. Further, it may be appropriate to conclude the reductions in ozone concentrations stemming from the reductions in NOx emissions are the primary channel for these health improvements; we cautiously report instrumental variable estimates that reveal positive relationships between ambient ozone concentrations and medication expenditures and mortality rates, respectively.

Willingness to pay (WTP) for well-being frequently depends on factors that enter the utility function directly (e.g., the probability of mortality, school quality, local crime rates, etc.) and compensatory investments that help to determine these factors (Grossman 1972). In a wide variety of contexts, the empirical literature has almost exclusively focused on the direct effects (e.g., health outcomes) of these factors and left the defensive investments largely unmeasured. As examples, there has been little effort to measure: the use of medications or air filters to protect against poor air quality (e.g., Chay and Greenstone 2003; Currie and Neidell 2005); parental expenditures on supplemental tutoring to improve educational outcomes for their children; or the costs of alarm systems and additional security to protect against crime.

The technology and digital financial risk management model using intelligent data processing,,"2. 
Driven by a new round of technology, the integration of traditional finance and technology continues to deepen, and financial technology emerges as the times require. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) defines financial technology as financial innovation enabled by technology. Moreover, financial technology can create new financial models and products, and reshape financial operation processes and applications, thereby having an important impact on financial markets, financial institutions and financial operations. Compared with traditional finance, with the empowerment of big data, cloud computing, blockchain, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and other technologies, the service efficiency of financial technology has been significantly improved. Moreover, the financial transaction boundary of financial institutions expands outwards and has significant decentralization characteristics [1]. Its innovative advantage lies in breaking the time and space limitations existing in the traditional financial model, getting rid of the constraints of physical outlets and manual services on financial services, and greatly reducing the cost of financial services, search costs and matching costs. Therefore, financial technology has the characteristics of inclusive finance, that is, ""financial services are available"", ""financing is available"" and ""financial infrastructure is universal"" [2]. However, the essence of financial technology is still finance, and its core function is still resource allocation. It uses modern Internet technology to innovate financial models and improve the efficiency of financial services. Therefore, financial technology also has financial risks, and compared with traditional financial models, in addition to traditional financial risks, there are also technical risks caused by technological empowerment.","""1"": ""Financial technology poses a threat to financial stability and may cause potential harm due to information asymmetry and technical difficulties in regulation."",  ""2"": ""Financial technology is defined as financial innovation enabled by technology, which can create new financial models and products and reshape financial operations."",  ""3"": ""Financial technology has the characteristics of inclusive finance, providing availability of financial services, financing, and universal financial infrastructure."",  ""4"": ""Financial technology improves service efficiency by breaking time and space limitations, reducing the cost of financial services, search costs, and matching costs."",  ""5"": ""Financial technology carries both traditional financial risks and technical risks caused by technological empowerment."""
Effect of armed conflicts on humanitarian operations: Total factor productivity and efficiency of rural hospitals,"5.
Based on the data, we obtain TFP as the residual of a Cobb Douglas production function using a fixed effect model for years 2007e2011 and estimate the relative efficiency of hospitals using data envelopment analysis. We find that conflict has a positive effect on TFP while it has a negative effect on efficiency. The results also show that efficiency variability is higher in peace and post-conflict hospitals and lower in medium and severe-conflict hospitals. In addition, we find that both TFP and efficiency increase in post conflict. These results lead to operations management implications and opportunities for future research related to sourcing decisions, supply chain and workforce flexibility, behavioral impacts on the workforce, and humanitarian response to conflicts.","2.

"Which night lights data should we use in economics, and where?","In the main part of the paper we report on the relationship between night lights and Indonesian GDP at the second sub-national level for 497 spatial units. The DMSP data do not appear to be a suitable proxy for GDP outside of cities, with a negative relationship between DMSP lights and the real GDP of non-urban spatial units, while VIIRS data positively relate to GDP. The negative lights-GDP relationship is especially for rural areas of low population density, in line with the conclusion of Chen and Nordhaus (2011) that luminosity data do not provide reliable estimates of economic activity for low output density regions. A related finding with cross-country data comes from Keola et al. (2015); DMSP night lights negatively relate to GDP if agriculture is a large share of GDP, while there is a positive relationship otherwise. In Indonesia’s urban sector, the lights-GDP relationship is positive irrespective of the type of night lights data used, but the relationship is twice as noisy if the DMSP data are used rather than the VIIRS data. We also find spatial inequality considerably understated by the DMSP data, especially in the urban sector. A Pareto-based adjustment from Bluhm and Krause (2018) to deal with top-coding in DMSP data has a modest effect but the adjusted data still greatly understate spatial inequality, and miss much of the intra-city heterogeneity in brightness (coming from key economic facilities) for Jakarta.

Similar patterns are evident for the other two countries we study. Spatial inequality is understated if the DMSP data are used as a proxy for local economic activity, especially in the urban sector or in higher density regions. Night lights data have higher predictive power for sub-national GDP when working with more aggregated spatial units, such as prov inces, while the gap between DMSP and VIIRS in terms of predictive power gets wider for analyses based on smaller or lower level units within the administrative hierarchy. The data for China allow us to compare lights-GDP relationships in the primary sector with those in industrial and services sectors and this comparison shows that night lights data are a poor proxy for primary sector economic activity. Overall, our results suggest that great caution is needed if development economists use night lights data, not only for low density rural areas but also when studying the spatial patterns of urban development.","Continued use of DMSP data by economists reflects several factors. First, there is larger scholarly impact, in terms of citations, from Henderson et al. (2012) who argue DMSP lights data can be used successfully in a wide range of circumstances, than from Chen and Nordhaus (2011) who offer more limited support.2 Second, the longer DMSP time-series, from 1992 to 2013, is attractive to economists. Two caveats to that potential advantage are that night lights do better at predicting differences in economic variables over space than changes in those variables over time (Nordhaus and Chen, 2015; Goldblatt et al., 2020; Gibson and Boe-Gibson, 2020), and the time-series is old, with DMSP data stopping in 2013 while VIIRS data are available monthly with only a slight lag.3 Also, economists may have more slowly switched to using VIIRS night lights data, compared to other disciplines, because flaws in DMSP data are rarely highlighted in the economics literature. The remote sensing literature has several comparisons that highlight the superiority of VIIRS (e.g. Elvidge et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2014; Chen and Nordhaus, 2015, 2019) but these studies are rarely cited in economics journals.","""1"": ""Night lights data, specifically the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data, are used as a proxy for estimating regional GDP and inequality in rural and urban areas."",  ""2"": ""Over 150 studies in economics use night lights data, with most using DMSP data."",  ""3"": ""DMSP data has flaws including blurring, coarse resolution, no calibration, low dynamic range, top-coding, and unrecorded variation in sensor amplification."",  ""4"": ""VIIRS data is superior to DMSP data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal comparability, and dynamic range."",  ""5"": ""Economists continue to use DMSP data due to larger scholarly impact and the longer time-series available."""
Pollution exposure and social conflicts: Evidence from China’s daily data,"The results of this paper offer compelling evidence on the short-term effects of pollution exposure on public governance by establishing its causal link to social conflicts at both daily and monthly frequencies, shedding light on a large but previously overlooked consequence of air pollution. Our baseline estimates suggest that an increase in air pollution is positively associated with a higher likelihood and numbers of social conflicts. Furthermore, our instrumental variable approaches yield consistent but substantially larger results compared to the estimates in the baseline fixed effect model, suggesting significant bias if endogeneity is not accounted for. In terms of nonlinearity, the impacts of air pollution on social conflicts display a monotonically increasing pattern, highlighting the need for particular attention to severe air pollution. Our baseline findings are robust to numerous checks, including data manipulation, alternative fixed effects and model specification, alternative instrument using wind patterns, and placebo tests. In addition, we observe a significant difference in the impact of air pollution on social conflicts for indoor vs. outdoor workers, with cumulative effects at the monthly level, while the estimated coefficient is higher in developed regions than in developing regions at the daily frequency level, which may be related to their differences in the awareness of rights defense. Lastly, we use lottery sales as a measure of risk preference and find that rising air pollution increases lottery sales, suggesting that the causal effects of air pollution on social conflicts may be triggered by an increased propensity to engage in risky actions.","Similar to climatic changes, air pollution might have an important influence on social interactions (Tiihonen et al., 2017), yet few studies exploring this empirical issue exist. A broad range of studies have highlighted the adverse effects of air pollution on many outcomes, including crime (Burkhardt et al., 2020; Herrnstadt et al., 2021), labor productivity (Borgschulte et al., 2022) and other human behaviors (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2009), in the short and long run (Archsmith et al., 2018). More recent evidence in eco nomics demonstrates that exposure to air pollution can have adverse effects on the development of cognitive function and exacerbate the expression of anti-social behaviors associated with violence (Burkhardt et al., 2019; Sager, 2019; Walters, 2014). Accordingly, the possible underlying mechanism is that air pollution may alter the emotional disposition or risk preferences of individuals via some biological processes. Because of China’s extreme emphasis on maintaining social stability (i.e., “stability trumps everything” said by Deng Xiaoping), engaging in social conflicts, even for wage disputes, becomes a risky action. Thus, risk preferences, if associated with air pollution, could serve as a promising channel through which individuals’ decisions to participate in risky actions, such as social conflicts, may be affected. Individuals with increased risk preferences, under the influence of air pollution, may be more prone to being triggered. Thus, we first turn to the previous literature on medical and public health to reveal plausible mechanisms to establish the causal link between pollution exposure and social conflicts.

The medical and public health literature shows that air pollution might cause a series of physiological effects, which plausibly increase aggressive behaviors and contribute to violent crimes. For example, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can directly trigger an inflammatory response in the central nervous system (Block and Calderon-Garcidue ′ nas, ? 2009), which is closely linked with aggression, anxiety and depression (Herrnstadt et al., 2021) and even lead to criminal or violent activities (Lu et al., 2018). Long-term exposure to particulate matter and ozone is closely associated with reduced pulmonary function (Xu et al., 2021). Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin, reducing the amount of absorbed oxygen and impairing coordination and cognition (Amitai et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2018a). Furthermore, pollution exposure may result in various biological outcomes, as documented in the medical literature (Herrnstadt et al., 2021), including elevated levels of stress hormones (Li et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2013), reduced perceived control, increased impulsiveness, and changes in certain personality traits, such as time preferences (Lu et al., 2018; Power et al., 2015; Riis-Vestergaard et al., 2018; Sass et al., 2017). The latter outcome, i.e., time preferences, is related to the perceived risks and payoffs of violent behaviors (Bondy et al., 2020). In summary, if such pollution-related biological mechanisms are at play, exposure to air pollution, even in the short term, could be biologically linked to aggressive behaviors, eventually leading to increased social conflicts. In economics, several studies have explored links similar to those discussed in this paper, revealing potential mechanisms that may be at play. For instance, Sager (2019) demonstrates that how these channels can impair cognitive skills involved in driving performance, resulting in a 0.3–0.6% increase in the number of road traffic accidents per day for each additional 1 μg∕m3 of PM2.5 in the United Kingdom. Burkhardt et al. (2019) find that a 10% increase in same-day exposure to PM2.5 and ozone is associated with 0.14% and 0.3% increases in violent crimes, respectively. Moreover, exposure to air pollution could also be linked to negative emotions, which could underlie aggressive behaviors. For example, Zhang et al. (2017) show that air pollution reduces hedonic happiness and increases the rate of depressive symptoms.

The effect of customer and supplier concentrations on firm resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: Resource dependence and power balancing,,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been considered one of the biggest challenges since World War II (Pantano et al., 2020; Saiah et al., 2022). It not only threatens human health but also significantly cripples the global economy. One major economic manifestation is unprecedented disruptions and shifts in demand and supply (Craighead et al., 2020; Ivanov, 2020). Lock[1]down orders stifle demand for most goods and block the supply and movement of materials (Lee, Zhao, et al., 2020). The resumption of work and production sharply boosts demand but overwhelms supply lines (Lynch, 2021). These tumultuous disruptions in both the demand and supply ends have brought to the fore the importance of supply chain management more than ever before and have left managers wondering which supply chain characteristics can help firms combat and navigate the pandemic.",
Language and innovation,"Using a large sample of firms from 34 countries, we show that firms in countries where strong-FTR languages are spoken are less likely to engage in innovative activities than firms in countries where weak-FTR languages are spoken. After controlling for various firm-specific characteristics, formal institutions such as legal origin and patent rights protections and other informal institutions such as culture, we find that firms located in countries where strong-FTR languages are spoken register fewer patents and receive fewer citations than their weak-FTR counterparts. Economically, a strong-FTR language lowers patent counts by almost 11.2% from the mean value. Similarly, a strong-FTR language reduces citation counts by almost 27% from the mean value.","Dahl (1985) states that languages differ in how they grammatically reference the future. The particular language feature that underlies our study is future-time reference (FTR), which refers to whether the language requires speakers to grammatically mark future events. For example, English is a strong-FTR language that requires speakers to encode a distinction between present and future events, while German does not. To refer to future timing, an English speaker has to use future tense as denoted by will or going to. By contrast, a German speaker can reference a future event by using the present tense. The Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis (SWH) proposes that language structure may shape individuals’ beliefs and behaviors by affecting their perception of time. Specifically, grammatically separating the future and the present leads speakers to disassociate the future and the present, to feel that the future is more dis[1]tant and thus decrease the perceived present value of future rewards, devaluing future rewards. Abundant research in linguistics and psychology supports SWH and shows that languages discipline individuals’ decision-making and behaviors (Boroditsky, 2001; Evans & Levinson, 2009; Wolff & Holmes, 2011). Linking language to individual economic decisions, M. K. Chen (2013) finds that individuals speaking weak-FTR languages are more likely to engage in long-term[1]oriented behaviors, such as saving more, smoking less, practicing safer sex and being less obese. Subsequent studies attempt to associate language FTR with managers’ choices in the corporate domain. For example, S. Chen et al. (2017) show that firms located in countries where weak-FTR languages are spoken tend to have more precautionary savings. Liang et al. (2018) argue that firms located in countries where weak-FTR languages are spoken tend to invest more in corporate social responsibility and R&D. As innovation is a long-term process with high uncertainty (Holmstrom, 1989), SWH predicts that firms in countries where strong-FTR languages are spoken will engage in fewer innovative activities.",
The effect of rainfall changes on economic production,"We combine these rainfall measures with data on subnational eco nomic production from 1,554 regions across 77 countries3 resulting in over 30,000 observations over the past 40 years (see Methods for details). Using data at the subnational level allows for a more detailed spatial description of both climate and economic variables, which has been shown to help identify impacts in economic data3–5 . This is particularly crucial for assessments of rainfall, for which spatial variability is considerably larger than for temperature4 . We explicitly evaluate the spatial autocorrelation of these rainfall measures (Supplementary Fig. 1) at the subnational level of our economic data, the results of which suggest that the level of spatial detail used here is appropriate to address the problem of spatial aggregation (Supplementary Section 1). We then apply fixed-effects panel regression models to estimate the effect of these aspects of the distribution of daily rainfall on economic production. This approach uses within-region changes in climate variables from one year to the next to assess their impact on economic outcomes. As such, it allows us to account for unobserved differences between regions, contemporaneous global shocks and regional time trends (Methods), strengthening the identification of causal effects between changes in rainfall and economic production.","Considerable changes to Earth’s hydrological cycle are anticipated owing to anthropogenic climate change. The resulting effects on rainfall are heterogeneous across a variety of timescales and characteristics, reflecting the complex physical processes that underlie them. For example, daily rainfall extremes have increased globally8,9 owing to the relationship between atmospheric water vapour content and temperature10. Conversely, seasonal and annual averages are changing heterogeneously, with both regional wetting and drying, largely as a result of dynamical changes in the atmospheric circulation. Considering variability and seasonality adds further nuance to the anticipated response of rainfall to anthropogenic influence. Quantifying the costs of these complex changes remains an important barrier to a comprehensive assessment of the costs of climate change, particularly as rainfall has extensive potential for societal impacts. Alterations to water availability can subsequently affect agricultural productivity, metropolitan labour outcomes and the onset of conflict; in addition to which flash flooding can cause extensive damages and economic disruption.",
Intellectual capital and bank profitability: New evidence from Vietnam,"The findings show that there appear positive relationships between IC measures (VAIC and its components—human capital efficiency (HCE), capital employed efficiency (CEE), and structural capital efficiency (SCE)) and bank risk-adjusted returns in Vietnam. However, we find that the nonlinear relationships between IC measures (VAIC, HCE, and CEE) and bank profitability may exist. Also, higher profitability is associated with well-capitalized banks, those with lower liquidity risk, those with lending specialization, and small-sized ones. Furthermore, SOCBs tend to utilize intangible resources and human capital more efficiently than POCBs, thus earning higher profitability. The same is true for the case of foreign-owned banks with greater human capital efficiency.","Intellectual capital (IC) plays an essential role in a firm’s performance and creating value. It represents distinctive characteristics that, ceteris paribus, can determine the success or failure of a firm compared to its peers (El-Bannany, 2008). In the knowledge-based socio-economic period where IC is considered as one of the production factors, it is not surprising that IC has been much[1]received attention from many researchers from different disciplines, especially management, accounting, and finance. While several studies have attempted to define IC from a theoretical perspective (Bontis, 1998; Wu & Tsai, 2005), others have developed effective measures of IC-based performance (Pulic, 2000) or explored the relationship between IC efficiency and some key characteristics of firms, industries, and regions (El-Bannany, 2008; Liang et al., 2011). The last strand focuses on empirically examining the effect of IC efficiency on financial performance. Despite many studies on this strand, there are a limited number of studies that attempt to test this link in the banking sector. It is acknowledged that the banking industry is one of the most knowledge-intensive industries (Firer & Mitchell Williams, 2003; Mavridis & Kyrmizoglou, 2005) and represents an ideal setting for research on IC. One may argue that banks may gain valuable competitive advantages by tightening their relationship with their customers and making valuable investments in soft information production (Boot, 2000). Other studies however emphasize that an efficient IC is more important for achieving success in banking than other industries since the higher quality of products and/services offered to customers depends on the bank’s investments associated with IC such as human resources, brand building, systems, and processes. Hence, banks should manage their IC as efficiently as possible.","""1"": ""The study examines the relationship between intellectual capital (IC) and bank profitability in the context of Vietnam."",  ""2"": ""It explores the impact of IC measures on risk-adjusted returns and investigates the existence of a U-shaped relationship between IC measures and bank profitability."",  ""3"": ""Additionally, it analyzes the differences in this relationship among different types of bank ownership."",  ""4"": ""Intellectual capital (IC) plays an essential role in a firm’s performance and creating value."",  ""5"": ""It represents distinctive characteristics that can determine the success or failure of a firm compared to its peers."",  ""6"": ""IC has received attention from many researchers from different disciplines, especially management, accounting, and finance."",  ""7"": ""Several studies have attempted to define IC from a theoretical perspective and develop effective measures of IC-based performance."",  ""8"": ""The banking industry is one of the most knowledge-intensive industries and represents an ideal setting for research on IC."",  ""9"": ""Banks may gain valuable competitive advantages by tightening their relationship with customers and making valuable investments in soft information production."",  ""10"": ""An efficient IC is more important for achieving success in banking than other industries."",  ""11"": ""The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with Vietnam being one of the leaders in economic performance."",  ""12"": ""The banking system is the backbone of the Vietnamese economy."",  ""13"": ""Healthy and sustainable profitability is one of the main predictors of financial distress and a bank crisis."",  ""14"": ""The presence of foreign-owned banks in the market has increased, resulting in fierce competition for deposits and loans."",  ""15"": ""Domestic banks should further improve their IC efficiency to compete."","
Does CSR Reduce Idiosyncratic Risk? Roles of Operational Efficiency and AI Innovation,"We first document that CSR can significantly and negatively affect IR. A firm’s one standard deviation increase in CSR will lead to a 0.655% decrease in IR. Subsequently, we include CSR-squared in our model and find that its coefficient is positive and significant, indicating that the relationship between CSR and IR is U-shaped. To explore the proposed underlying mechanism of this relationship, we analyze the effects of the two moderating variables (OE and AII) on the relationship obtained with the basic model. As we supposed, OE moderates the relationship by shifting the turning point to the right. This means that OE weakens the negative effect of CSR and thus high-OE firms can obtain a lower IR by improving CSR. Mean[1]while, AII moderates the U-shaped relationship by flattening the curve. This indicates that AII inhibits CSR’s positive effect, which conforms to the substitution effect of AII on CSR. These findings verify our analysis of the U-shaped relationship in which CSR has both negative and positive influences on IR. We also conduct several robustness checks and show that our results are consistent. Finally, we provide a discussion of these results and their managerial implications.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to various initiatives and activities taken by enterprises to achieve long-term economic, environmental, and social benefits (Du et al. 2011). With the development of technology and increasing social awareness of responsibility, CSR has been increasingly regarded as a vital competitive strategy for firms to mitigate risk (e.g., Godfrey 2005). Nevertheless, whether idiosyncratic risk (IR) in stock prices—an important financial indicator accounting for 85% of total risk (Goyal and Santa-Clara 2003)—can be reduced by engaging in CSR activities remains unclear. Notably, IR is the volatility of a company’s stock price caused by specific events (e.g., oil spills or labor strikes) that mainly influence only that company (Bansal and Clelland 2004, Luo and Bhattacharya 2009). Different from IR (or unsystematic risk), systematic risk refers to the sensitivity to deflation, exchange rate adjustment, and other common market changes that can affect all stocks (Luo and Bhattacharya 2009), and it accounts for the rest of total risk (15%). As such, investors and managers are more concerned about IR than about systematic risk. In particular, as IR is an important component of shareholder wealth (Srinivasan and Hanssens 2009), investors are more willing to choose stocks with a lower IR than those with a higher IR. Managers also care about IR, as companies with high IR often have difficulty in obtaining a stable cash flow and in developing new businesses. This may influence their ability to service debt and thus lead to company failure (Bansal and Clelland 2004). Therefore, IR is a vital risk that firms must consider and we focus on how CSR influences firm IR.","""1"": ""The identification strategy involves collecting data on Chinese firms listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) from 2010 to 2017."",  ""2"": ""Monthly financial data and a four-factor asset pricing model are used to calculate idiosyncratic risk (IR) at the firm-year level."",  ""3"": ""Operational efficiency (OE) is measured using the stochastic frontier approach."",  ""4"": ""Artificial intelligence innovation (AII) is measured as the logarithm of AI-related invention patents and utility model patents."","
The deforestation effects of trade and agricultural productivity in Brazil,"Our findings unveil the distinct impacts of these two shocks and underscore the necessity of considering them together. When examining the effects of trade and productivity in isolation, we find that municipalities more exposed to the rising export demand from China experienced a more rapid decline in forest cover compared to less exposed areas. Similarly, municipalities with greater exposure to productivity gains from GE soy seeds experienced increased deforestation compared to areas that did benefit from the new technology. However, when these two are considered together, we find that only the GE soy seed shock remains statistically significant and economically meaningful. This implies that one would arrive at different conclusions regarding the impact of local exposure to export demand when analyzing it in isolation from the largest agricultural technological shock during that period.

We then investigate the combined effects of being exposed to both GE soy seeds and Chinese demand by adding an interaction between the two shocks to our econometric model. We find that while Chinese demand did not seem to exert a substantial direct differential impact on deforestation, it mitigated the deforestation impacts arising from GE soy seeds. This is because municipalities highly exposed to both shocks underwent a transition from cultivating other crops to soybeans, relieving pressure on the primary ecosystem and thereby reducing the relative impact of GE soy on deforestation.

We also break down the impacts on the extensive margin of crop production. We find that exposure to GE seeds increases the likelihood that a municipality engages in soy production, with this effect being more pronounced in municipalities exposed to both shocks. Interestingly, Chinese demand appears to have decreased the probability of soy cultivation in a given municipality. These findings suggest that GE seeds pushed soy production to areas that were previously economically unviable, with the effect being stronger in areas concurrently exposed to Chinese demand shocks. However, the soy extensive margin impact of the combined shocks was not enough to drive deforestation up, because of the reduction in the area allocated to other crops and in the probability of these other crops being planted.","The effects of trade and agricultural productivity on deforestation are theoretically ambiguous (Grossman and Krueger, 1991, Jayachandran, 2021, Balboni et al., 2023). On the one hand, heightened productivity may result in production intensification, reducing the necessity for expanding agricultural land. On the other hand, increased productivity can attract capital and labor into the agricultural sector, expanding the agriculture frontier over the forests. Furthermore, technology and trade are interconnected (Autor et al., 2015). For example, trade can yield productivity gains by offering access to cheaper inputs and stimulating innovation.4 Simultaneously, improvements in agricultural productivity can alter a country’s comparative advantage, fostering production specialization. Importantly, the full benefits of agricultural productivity gains can only be realized in the presence of domestic or international demand for those products.",
"Trust, violence, and coca","Broadly, this paper presents three sets of results. First, at the mean, violence has a negative and statistically significant effect on different measures of social capital. The estimated effect is quantitatively large and robust to alternative explanations of spillover effects and economic activity. A one standard deviation increase in the rate of violence is associated with a 38%, 22%, and 23% standard deviation decrease in trust, participation in community organizations, and contribution to solving problems, respectively. The magnitude of the effect is relatively large; taking trust as an example, this corresponds to the difference in trust levels between Germany and Colombia.6 Second, these results seem to be driven by the fact that (as observed in other non-related conflicts) no basic cues were available to identify friend from foe, making people especially wary about whom they could trust. To this regard, I present evidence that individuals were afraid to interact with their communities. Indeed, they report a fear of running in local elections as well as of participating in community organizations as a result of non-identifiable perpetrators.

Finally, I document that the intensity of the exposure to violence matters as well. Low exposure to violence fosters social capital, possibly because local cooperation serves as a strategy to confront external threats. However, as violence becomes increasingly severe, social capital is negatively affected, consistent with the theoretical framework presented by Jennings and Sanchez-Pages (2017). My estimates imply that individuals living in a Colombian municipality with the same level of violence as in the U.S., become more involved with their communities when experiencing violence, arguably a way of reacting in difficult times. This contrasts with an observed decrease in social capital in municipalities that have experienced levels of violence similar to Brazil or Mexico. Additionally, I show that when communities are able to identify the perpetrators, the decrease in social capital is less strong as compared to when it is not possible to identify the perpetrators. Thus, the results of this study provide crucial insights for understanding the effects of conflict in other developing countries.","Colombia provides an ideal setting for studying this question for a number of reasons. First, this country has one of the highest levels of violence worldwide. For the period of analysis, the homicide rate was 25 per 100,000 individuals. There is, moreover, substantial variation in violence over time and across the nation (UNODC, 2009).4 Second, Colombia has collected data on social capital measures during times of conflict, whereas most of the currently available evidence is based on post-conflict settings. Third, armed groups largely rely on the production of coca to finance their fighting, such that exogenous shocks to the Colombian coca market can be used to identify the effect of violence on social capital. These exogenous sources of variation are given by cross-sectional variation in the ecological conditions for growing coca, and shocks in other coca-producing countries. I am thus able to combine rich data on conflict with different measures of social capital, with location fixed effects. Finally, the Colombian conflict is not driven by polarizations based on readable characteristics, such as religion or ethnicity, but rather offers a unified setting, where it is possible to distinguish between clashes where the perpetrators can, or cannot, be identified. I argue that this particular feature of the conflict allows to study the seemingly contradictory effects of conflict on social capital presented in the literature.",
Mothers at peace: International peacebuilding and post-conflict fertility,"Our findings suggest that peacebuilding has a significant, negative effect on fertility. We find that the likelihood of having a child decline by 5 percentage points and the total number of children per woman drops by 24% for women close to UN bases. This effect is particularly pronounced among older and married women, and those with more children at the time of the UN deployment. In exploring the mechanisms underpinning these findings, we find evidence of increased contraceptive use, increased access to healthcare and better health outcomes for women and children, which suggest a shift towards a “quality over quantity” approach to parenting. In addition, we observe a shift in parents' employment away from farming toward more clerical jobs as well as sales and service sectors, which have higher labour productivity and higher salaries, resulting in a higher childbearing opportunity cost.","The UN has established over 70 peacekeeping operations (PKOs) worldwide since 1960, in an effort to stabilize conflict zones and protect civilians. Currently, approximately 70,000 multinational personnel, also known as Blue Helmets, are deployed in 12 operations across the world, tasked with maintaining or enforcing peace. Despite facing a persistent shortage of resources and the failure to protect civilians in some emblematic cases, such as Rwanda, large-N studies demonstrate that peacekeeping has a positive effect on reducing violence in ongoing civil wars and the likelihood of conflict reoccurrence, even in the most challenging contexts (e.g., Beardsley 2011; Bove et al., 2020; Di Salvatore and Ruggeri 2017; Hegre et al., 2019; Hultman et al., 2013; Ruggeri et al., 2017). Peacekeepers also contribute to household well-being by revitalizing economic exchanges, promoting labour market participation, and building confidence and trust (Beber et al., 2019; Bove and Elia, 2018; Bove et al., 2021; Carnahan et al., 2006; Caruso et al., 2017; Cil et al., 2019; Nomikos 2022).1 The presence of peacekeepers has also a positive effect on maternal health outcomes, reducing maternal mortality rates and increasing access to services and education for women (Gizelis and Cao 2021).

UN peacekeeping missions are crucial in ensuring that basic public services, including medical services, are available and accessible by vulnerable populations. This is due to the security they provide. In addition, they oftentimes directly provide essential healthcare equipment and products.2 Indeed, contemporary UN interventions are not limited to keeping the peace – they aim at building sustainable and long-term peace (Campbell and Di Salvatore, 2023).3 This implies that the presence of UN peacekeepers not only offers a reduction in violence, but also the security umbrella essential to the provision of and access to basic public services and to the revival of the local economic activites. This article focuses on how peacekeeping operations, by enabling NGOs and governments to function more effectively and promoting revitalization of economic activities, are expected to affect fertility rates. Indeed, this enhanced peace provided by UN interventions creates a qualitative difference from post-conflict settings where peace is present but access to services may still be lacking.","""Political background"": ""The political background of the explanatory variable is the United Nations peacekeeping missions, which aim to stabilize conflict zones and protect civilians.

Extreme heat and rural household adaptation: Evidence from Northeast China,"We find that extreme heat significantly reduces corn yields and leads to substantial economic losses of corn-growing households in northeast China. A one-standard-deviation increase in harmful degree days (HDD) – a measure of extreme heat – decreases corn yields by more than 11% (significant at the 0.001 level) and leads to a roughly 6% reduction in total farm revenue (significant at the 0.05 level). Although the economic loss is substantial, the impacted households have successfully smoothed their consumption. Our results show that increasing HDD has almost no contemporaneous effect on the household’s total living expenses and itemized expenditures on food, fuel, service, and inter-household transfers. The consumption impact is also very limited in the post-shock years, given that we only observe a modest curtailment in the non-essential demand in years after the households experience heat shocks.

We illustrate that the households smooth their consumption mainly through using liquid financial assets and available buffer stocks. Leveraging detailed information on various assets, we find that both cash in hand and corn stocks are significantly drawn down when the households experience an increase in HDD, especially among the households who regularly maintain these buffers. We interpret these smoothing behaviors as evidence that the households have engaged in precautionary saving as a coping strategy for unanticipated income shocks. Consistent with this motive, we find that the impacted households promptly re-build their depleted financial assets and stocks in years after experiencing extreme heat. In our context, utilizing cash and stocks for compensating heat-induced revenue losses is proven to be very effective. With a decomposition analysis, we show that the cash savings would mitigate roughly half of the revenue loss and the stocks would compensate for another one third.

With the capability of smoothing consumption effectively, the corn households in our context may have a low incentive for engaging in costly contemporaneous production adjustments. Indeed, unlike within-season input adjustments documented in other developing country contexts, we find no significant response among rural households in northeast China in any of the variable inputs including fertilizer, pesticides, power, labor, and irrigation use, and there has also been no contemporaneous adjustment in land use. However, forward-looking households may adjust production in response to past shocks, anticipating potential losses induced by extreme heat in the future. In particular, we find that, over the three years after the shock, the impacted households adjust their crop mix toward a portfolio with a larger share of heat-resistant but lower-value crops, consistent with the precautionary-saving motive reflected in their asset management.","Our empirical context focuses on the northeast region in China, which has a vast population in rural areas, provides agricultural products feeding billions of people, while also experiences rapid warming in climate. The households we examine are still characterized as small farmers but most of them no longer live at or below the subsistence level. In addition to characterizing adaptation from both consumption and production sides, documenting their responses to extreme heat fills in gaps in understanding the adaptive behaviors of many small rural households in the middle-income, transitioning and emerging economies.",
The demography of the great migration in China,"We incorporate both the demographic impact of migration and economies of agglomeration into a single theoretical framework with economic explanations of understanding the mechanism behind the push, pull, and agglomeration factors (Roback, 1982, Borjas, 1987). From the theoretical model, we bring in the empirical tests of a gravity model consistent with the theoretical predictions. We find that an increase in rural cohort size by 1,000 people pushes 125 rural migrants out of the origin prefecture, while a reduction in urban cohort sizes in destination prefectures by 1,000 people pulls 769 rural migrants into the destination prefecture. Besides the demography of migration, the economies of agglomeration work in the opposite direction: An increase in urban population size by 1,000 people attracts 352 rural migrants from the less developed origin prefecture. Our results are also robust to various concerns, including differential trends by the initial development levels, institutional reforms on the household registration system, trade-induced demand shocks, and the measurement of migration flows. Compared with cross-country studies, the study of internal migration within a country limits the size of unobserved heterogeneity, e.g., differences in labor market institutions. Our findings on the asymmetric impact of pull and push factors, i.e., the effects of push factors are smaller than that of pull factors, are also emphasized in the international migration literature (Mayda, 2010).","China’s internal migration has recorded the largest people flow in history. Approximately 150 million rural Chinese moved to urban areas at the beginning of the 1990s (Freeman, 2006). In 2020, 286 million rural migrants were recorded by China’s National Bureau of Statistics, accounting for 20% of the country’s total population. To put this in a global perspective, the volume of China’s internal migration is comparable to that of the world’s international migration, which stood at 281 million in 2020 according to the International Organization for Migration of the United Nations (McAuliffe and Triandafyllidou, 2021).","""1"": ""The demographic impact of migration and economies of agglomeration are incorporated into a theoretical framework."","
