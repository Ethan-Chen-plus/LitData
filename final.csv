The paper uses a difference-in-differences (DID) method with comprehensive administrative panel data to compare participants in the Anti-Poverty Relocation Program (APRP) with non-participants who are otherwise identically impoverished. Entropy balancing and inverse-probability-weighting methods are used to obtain a valid estimation of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).

The paper investigates the impact of the APRP, a major program of China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation strategy, on participating households' economic outcomes. It explores the economic logic behind the effects of the program, focusing on the comparative advantage in sectors, switching costs, and compensating differentials in amenities of residence. The study finds a positive average treatment effect on the treated, with substantial heterogeneity in the effects. It also identifies the critical mechanism that decreases the switching cost from the agricultural to the non-agricultural sector with a short-distance relocation. </s><s>Assistant: 
A conceptual framework is thus adopted that accounts for the comparative advantage in sectors, switching costs, and compensating differential in amenities of residence to understand the APRP’s impact. Based on the conceptual framework, we hypothesize a positive average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of the APRP on participating households’ economic outcomes. A positive ATT arises because households with comparative advantage in the non-agricultural sector opt for the program and the program reduces switching costs across sectors by improving transportation conditions, access to non-agricultural job opportunities, and the propensity to migrate to other cities.

We test our theoretical predictions with a difference-in-differences (DID) method by utilizing comprehensive and fine-scale administrative panel data of 45,059 impoverished people in an impoverished county in China, comparing participants in the APRP with non-participants who are otherwise identically impoverished. Regarding the difference in the treatment and control groups, we use entropy balancing (Hainmueller, 2012) and inverse-probability-weighting methods (Wooldridge, 2010) in combination with post-double selection of controls (Belloni et al., 2014) to obtain a valid estimation of the ATT. We also incorporate a battery of robustness checks to establish causality, including the Oster test (Oster, 2019) and the permutation test, as well as controlling for other TPA programs and exploiting variation generated by the phase-in nature of the program. </s>"

The paper uses a quasi-experimental approach to identify the effect of group proliferation on political violence. It exploits the split of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) into the BLA and United Baloch Army (UBA) as an exogenous event. The timing of the split and the overlapping area of operations allow for event studies and difference-in-difference specifications.
The paper examines the impact of the proliferation of armed groups on organized political violence. It finds that an additional armed group increases the frequency and severity of violence. The competition effect between armed groups dominates, but the original group is able to compensate for the negative capacity effect by switching strategies. </s><s>Assistant: 
This paper provides quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of group proliferation on the frequency and intensity of organized political violence. We exploit a unique setting in which the number of armed groups increases through a split of a separatist group that is plausibly exogenous to the conflict dynamics. Specifically, we exploit the split of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) into the BLA and United Baloch Army (UBA), operating primarily within districts of the Balochistan province in Pakistan. The split between the BLA and UBA goes back to a leadership dispute between two brothers who, in short, could not agree on the organization’s leadership. While disagreement between the brothers could be related to some unobserved conflict dynamics, the split of the BLA has the additional feature that the groups only effectively split after the father of the two brothers, who suppressed open conflict between them, died of natural causes following a relatively short and severe illness.

The exogenous timing of the father’s death and the groups’ overlapping area of operations allows us to specify event studies and generalized difference-in-difference (DiD) specifications. We test if districts in which the BLA has traditionally been more active experience more violence following the split. Moreover, we use the DiD setup as a shift share instrument for the number of active armed groups operating within districts.

Our empirical analysis combines data from multiple publicly available data sources on political violence committed by the various armed groups within Pakistan. To measure the number of armed groups correctly, we systematically document all mergers and splits of armed groups in Pakistan between 1990 and 2018. Thus, we provide a unified analysis of organized political violence, including terrorism, guerilla warfare, as well as more symmetric forms of political violence. This allows us to test if armed groups change their strategies in response to increased competition. Recent theoretical and empirical work highlights that groups alter their strategies in response to changing constraints, of which increased competition could be an important factor.

Combining data on terrorism from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) (START, 2019) and political violence more broadly from the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) (Sundberg and Melander, 2013) allows us to increase coverage and proxy for government counter -insurgency efforts. We differentiate insurgency from counterinsurgency by exploiting the different inclusion criteria of events for each database. Accounting for counter-insurgency activity highlights that the violence is primarily driven by armed groups and not by the government’s reaction to the split of the BLA. </s>"

The identification strategy used in the paper is a geographical sampling strategy of schools based on historical features pre-dating the appearance of military checkpoints. This minimizes concerns about pre-existing differences related to the non-random location of checkpoints.
The paper examines the effect of growing up amid conflict on the development of reciprocal behavior among Palestinian adolescents. It focuses on the domains of cooperation and aggression and investigates the role of checkpoint crossing in influencing reciprocal behavior. The study finds that adolescents obliged to cross checkpoints engage in more reciprocal behavior and hold subjective beliefs about classmates behaving aggressively. </s><s>Assistant: 
In this paper, we present an observational study that employs experimental games to study the effect of growing up amid conflict on the development of reciprocal behavior, both in the domain of cooperation and in the domain of aggression. We provide evidence on a group of adolescents, a key period of life for the formation of reciprocal preferences (Blakemore, 2018), from a context of ongoing conflict. The study was conducted with 1,172 Palestinian adolescents in secondary education schools in the West Bank region of the Palestinian territories, some of whom are more exposed to a direct manifestation of the conflict than others: while occasionally crossing checkpoints is part of the daily life broadly of all Palestinians, some adolescents must regularly go through military checkpoints. The obligation comes from the location of checkpoints in between their home and the location of their school (which for public education, we show, is almost always the closest school, ruling out school choice sorting). Using a geographical sampling strategy of schools based on historical features pre-dating the checkpoints appearance, we minimize the concern that differences in behavior pick up pre-existing differences related to the non-random location of checkpoints.

We employ public good games to measure reciprocity in the domain of cooperation, using the methodology adopted by Fischbacher et al. (2001). We use vendetta games, two player interactive tasks where retaliation can but need not arise, as a natural and simple way to measure reciprocity in the domain of aggression. Crossing checkpoints, which may be manned by armed military personnel, is associated with higher exposure to physical violence and verbal abuse.1 Our hypotheses on the effects of checkpoint crossing on reciprocity are therefore informed by findings in social psychology concerning aggression and experiences of violence: a set of established findings suggest that exposure to violence may strengthen reciprocal preferences by lowering the threshold for perceiving the behavior of other agents as hostile (e.g. Novaco and Chemtob, 1998; Schwartz and Proctor, 2000; Guerra et al., 2003). Informed by this work, we investigate one potential mechanism of changes in reciprocal behavior: changes in the beliefs’ about other people’s behavior, by collecting incentivized information about the subjective beliefs about the behavior of classmates. </s>"

The identification strategy relies on a natural experiment in Huambo province, Angola, where the exogenous variation in exposure to wartime sexual violence against women is used to study its impact on intimate partner violence. The study exploits the fact that certain armed group and date of birth combinations had a higher risk of exposure to sexual violence during the Angolan Civil War.
The paper examines the long-term impacts of exposure to wartime sexual violence against women on the propensity of male veterans to commit intimate partner violence. The study finds that exposure to such violence significantly increases the likelihood of committing violence against a female intimate partner even years after the war. The underlying mechanism is identified as a lasting reduction in self-control. </s><s>Assistant: 
Theoretically, it is a priori unclear whether a man ’s exposure to collective sexual violence against women increases or decreases his long-run propensity to commit IPV. We propose and test five theoretical mechanisms: a shift in traditional norms of gender identity and re lations, the creation of violent models, a decrease in self-control, psychological distress, and a reduction in intra-household bargaining power.

Testing the causal net relationship and the underlying mechanisms presents considerable data and identification challenges. First, high quality micro-level data on conflict experiences beyond exposure to battle-field violence are scarce (Brück et al., 2016). Second, unobserved individual-level factors may vary simultaneouslywith wartime exposure to sexual violence and domestic violence today. To overcome the data challenges, we collected detailed primary survey data on exposure to wartime sexual violence from 578 Angolan war veterans, and on IPV today from their intimate partners4 as part of a larger mixed-method research project. To establish causality, we rely on a natural experiment in Huambo province, the epicenter of the 1975 –2002 Angolan Civil War.

Our survey dataset includes detailed information on war and military service experiences, pre-service background characteristics and postwar social behaviors in 2014. The questionnaire was strongly informed by twelve months of ethnographic research into social behaviors and wartime experiences among ex-combatants in Huambo province (Spall, 2015). To reduce bias from self-reporting committed acts of IPV, we rely on information from the man’s partner, collected in separate but simultaneous, private interviews with a femaleenumerator, and based on standard Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) protocols and survey instruments.

Our identification strategy exploits that the Angolan war created exogenous variation in how likelyit was that an individualsoldier would be exposed to wartime sexual violence against women. The war was characterized by mass militarization and military competition between two high-capacity actors, the Movimento Popular de Liberta? ? ao de Angola (MPLA) government and the Uni ? ao Nacional para a Independ?encia Total de Angola (UNITA) rebels. Throughout the war, both sides used their institutional capacity to enforce compulsory military service for all men at (approximately) the age of 20 in territoriesunder their control, which changed often and extensively during the war. Universal conscription exogenously selected individuals into different military entry dates (based on their date of birth)and different armed groups (due to shiftsin territorial control).

Specifically, we exploit that for a specific subset of the armed group and date of birth combinations the ex-ante risk of exposure to sexual violence was much higher than for all others. While most of the time levels of sexual violence were low for both groups, there were two brief spikes in wartime sexual violence by MPLA, which were more than two?decades apart (one in the late 1970s and one in the late 1990s). The natural recruitment experiment thus suggests that men born about 20 years before one of the two spikes and recruited into MPLA (the “highrisk group ”) were at a much higher risk of exposure than all other combinations of birth dates and armed groups. </s>"

The paper uses a field experiment in Johannesburg, South Africa to examine the impact of reducing search costs on job-seekers' learning and employment outcomes.
The paper explores the interaction between search costs and beliefs in the context of high youth unemployment rates in developing economies. It finds that reducing search costs leads to more intensive job search, revised beliefs, and a shift in job preferences towards lower-paying jobs in the job-seekers' own township. </s><s>Assistant: 
Our experiment takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa, a country where high estimated youth unemployment coexists with strong demand for labour (Banerjee et al., 2008).3 Like a growing number of cities in the developing world, Johannesburg combines limited transport infrastructure with a spatial mismatch between jobs and low-income job-seekers, which results in very high search costs.4 Our sample consists of 1082 job-seekers in a large township in the outskirts of Johannesburg, aged between 18 and 32, who have completed at least secondary education, and who are actively searching for jobs.

We begin by documenting a striking optimism bias among jobseekers with respect to entry-level jobs: expected salaries at baseline are on average 1.7 times higher than the actual average salaries reported by employed individuals in the region with similar skills and age profiles. This bias appears to be driven mostly by an overestimation of the probability of getting into entry-level jobs in high-paying occupations, as opposed to inaccurate information about the entry-level wages for each type of job: 75% of job-seekers reported looking for a professional job, even though the actual probability of getting a professional job for an individual with a similar age and skill profile is only 11%.6 Moreover, respondents are also over-confident: they believe that their own starting salary is likely to be on average twice as large as the salary of job-seekers in their township who have a similar skill profile. In fact, respondents are optimistic across the board since they overestimate the probability of getting any type of job — 62% of them believe that it is likely or very likely that they will find a job within 2 months, despite having been on the job search for an average of 15 months. In this sense, our sample is similar to samples drawn from other labour force surveys in South Africa, which show average search time for jobs of 12 months or longer and high general levels of optimism (ILOSTAT, 2015; StatsSA, 2015).7 Since search costs for the city centre jobs they aspire to are high, search intensity is low and learning remains slow.
Our field experiment has three key features. First, we release the transport constraint by providing job search subsidies to a subset of randomly selected job-seekers and observe their search activity through the main bus rapid transit (BRT) network connecting the township to the city centre. Within the subsidy group, we randomize whether the recipient can decide to use the subsidy on anything other than transport.8 Second, we elicit beliefs about a range of aspects relevant to the job search, including the level of skill required for different types of jobs and associated wages, as well as beliefs about the key binding constraints to finding a job such as skills and transport costs. Importantly, we measure beliefs before, and twelve months after, the job search subsidy intervention. Third, we measure several features of the job search including the frequency of travel to the city centre, as well as employment decisions. The structure of the experiment helps us understand how search experience shapes beliefs and how beliefs drive subsequent employment decisions. </s>"

The paper uses the United States Acid Rain Program (ARP) as an exogenous change in pollution to identify the effects of long-run pollution exposure on mortality. It employs an event study analysis and a difference-in-differences model with varying exposure intensity.
The paper finds that reductions in long-term pollution concentrations from the ARP contributed to declining mortality rates. The effects are largest for the age 35–64 population, with a standard deviation increase in treatment exposure reducing annual cardiorespiratory mortality rate by 1.6 percent. </s><s>Assistant: 
Our main research design involves an event study analysis spanning 1985 through 2005. Treatment begins in 1995 with enforcement of the ARP, and ends in 2005, before changes to the SO2 permit market potentially shifted the relationship between regulation and ambient emissions. To construct a measure of each county’s exposure to treatment, we combine information on baseline plant efficiency, sulfur control installations (e.g., sulfur scrubbers), and atmospheric migration of SO2. Since evidence suggests PM2.5 drives mortality effects, we use a model of pollution transport to project how SO2 disperses to form PM2.5 across the country (Muller et al., 2014). This treatment variable provides a basis for a difference-in-differences model with varying exposure intensity. We estimate the dynamic, reduced-form effects of the ARP, tracing out the effects of the policy for up to 10 years, while also testing for pre-trends in mortality leading up to the ARP as a check on identifying assumptions. </s>"

The paper uses a structural approach to provide empirical evidence on the added marital value of sanitation interventions in India. It models the marriage decisions of men and women to decompose the total effect of the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) and identify the impact on marriage market outcomes.
The paper finds that gender-focused sanitation interventions, such as the TSC, can change marriage market outcomes in India. It shows that the TSC led to a significant increase in sanitation ownership among households active in the marriage market, particularly when the prospective spouse is male. The impact is larger in marriage markets where women are relatively scarce. The paper also highlights the redistribution of gains across matched types and within marriages due to the TSC. </s><s>Assistant: 
We develop and estimate a structural model that allows us to decompose and quantify this overall policy impact on marital sorting, marital surplus, and the division of that surplus among partners, thereby identifying the overall importance of sanitation in the marriage market. Our model of the marriage market uses a simple matching framework under transferable utility à la Choo and Siow (2006), in which prospective spouses match based on their wealth type. To allow for changes in the composition of who marries whom, and for differential unobserved marital preference, men and women simultaneously choose their spouse and whether the new living arrangement includes sanitation or not. In other words, prospective spouses decide not only whether to marry, and whom to marry, but also the type of living arrangement they want to share. Allowing for different types of living arrangements delivers an empirically tractable marital surplus function that permits sorting based on unobserved tastes for sanitation. We extend the framework to multiple markets using districts, and exploit variation over time (before and after TSC exposure) to achieve model identification. </s>"

The paper uses a randomized controlled trial design to test the effects of different interventions on sanitation adoption and maintenance in rural Bangladesh.
The paper explores social and financial incentives to overcome the collective action problem of open defecation in rural Bangladesh. It tests different interventions, including monetary rewards, recognition rewards, public commitments, and private commitments, to encourage households to adopt and maintain hygienic latrines. </s><s>Assistant: 
In this paper, we test several such tools designed to overcome this collective action problem in rural Bangladesh, a setting where social?and financial incentives to encourage sanitation adoption and maintenance are a promising alternative to command-and-control approaches. The interventions were designed to help groups of households overcome collective action failures impeding investment and maintenance of hygienic latrines. All participating households are grouped with 1520 neighbors who jointly participate in monthly meetings for 3 months with a health worker from a well-known NGO to discuss sanitation, OD and disease risk. On top of this common treatment, we randomize four additional treatments and study their effects.

The first treatment, a group ‘‘monetary reward’’, is a slight variation on the standard public finance policy prescription: a subsidy for a well-maintained hygienic latrine. The non-standard component is an element of joint liability: households receive the reward only if both that household’s latrine is hygienic and a certain share of all households in the group maintain a hygienic latrine. Given the financial sustainability concerns about such payments, we substitute a recognition certificate from the local government instead of money as our second treatment, and call this a ‘‘recognition reward’’. The same element of joint group liability is also present for this treatment, and only the form of the reward is changed. This treatment is more akin to certifications like open-defection-free (ODF) status sometimes conferred by governments to encourage investments in improved sanitation.

Our third treatment, ‘‘public commitment’’, explores whether a simple verbal coordination device between neighbors can sustain a cooperative equilibrium (Schelling, 1960). In public commitment groups, all households in the group are asked to make a joint public (but nonbinding) commitment in front of each other, stating that they will try to address the OD issue in their neighborhood by using and maintaining hygienic latrines. This public commitment could be operating through two mechanisms. First, the act of making a commitment is an ‘‘implementation intention’’ that can itself spur action (Gollwitzer and Brandst?tter, 1997). Second, the fact that this commitment is made in public in front of and with others who are making the same commitment simultaneously can help coordinate action. Our fourth treatment, ‘‘private commitment’’, was designed to separate these two mechanisms. In this arm, all group members are asked to make the same pledge as those in the public commitment arm, but this pledge is made in private only to the NGO health worker, so that it activates the implementation intention without offering the direct coordination device for neighbors.

These interventions are implemented between November 2013 and February 2014, covering 19,271 households in 107 villages in rural Tanore sub-district (upazila), Rajshahi district (zila), Bangladesh. Note that while our interventions are not household-specific and instead focused on groups and joint liability, the popular and sensible technology for this context is a private household-specific latrine, not a latrine that is shared between unrelated neighbors. We measure shortterm (at the time of the assessment for rewards, roughly 3 months after the interventions began) and medium-term (12–15 months after assessment) effects of the treatments on private, household-specific sanitation investments and maintenance. Earlier, between April and June 2012, we had tested a broader set of demand and supply-side interventions to also encourage investment in hygienic latrines in this same location (Guiteras et al., 2015). The group commitments and joint incentives – which are the focus of this study – were implemented around one and a half years after the interventions described in Guiteras et al. (2015) were completed. We conduct all our analysis controlling for sanitation ownership in June 2013 (which acts as the baseline for this study), which is a full year after the earlier round of interventions were completed, so household exposure to those earlier treatments should not materially affect the comparison between our new treatments reported in this paper.

Another distinguishing characteristic of this study is that while our earlier research primarily focused on the initial sanitation investment decision, we now carefully measure proper use and maintenance beyond the initial adoption. Sustaining intervention effects has been an important challenge for the sanitation sector (Coffey et al., 2014; OrgillMeyer et al., 2019; Pakhtigian et al., 2021; Deutschmann et al., 2021). Hygienic latrines only produce health benefits if they are consistently used and are kept in good condition so that fecal pathogens are safely isolated from the environment. This requires each household to incur time and materials costs to keep the latrine clean, conduct maintenance and dispose of waste properly. </s>"

In this study, we examine the long-term consequences of China’s LLF policies on the well-being of the elderly who are aged 60 and above.

To estimate the effect of LLF policies, we construct a policy exposure measure that varies at cohort-by-province level using differential establishment years of the Family Planning Leading Group—a government institution that was mainly responsible for implementing the LLF policies—in the early 1970s. In this sense, our empirical strategy is effectively a cohort difference-in-difference (DID) approach. We provide a set of evidence supporting the parallel-trend assumption—the identification requirement of DID. The establishment years are not associated with provincial economic conditions, and our results are robust to various functional specifications that control for heterogeneous trends. Our estimates are also robust to controls for various contemporaneous events, including the Cultural Revolution, the Send-down Movement, and economic development. </s>"

The paper uses a macroeconomic model to analyze the trade-off between lives and livelihoods during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically focusing on the differences in policy responses between rich and poor countries.
The paper argues that poor countries were justified in imposing equally harsh restrictions as rich countries due to their close proximity to subsistence constraints and the increasing value of lives relative to income in poorer countries. </s><s>Assistant: 
In this paper, we ask whether poor countries were justified in imposing equally harsh restrictions as rich countries – despite fewer demographic risk factors and lower ability to weather economic shocks. We show that these similar policy responses between rich and poor countries can be rationalized by extending a standard macroeconomic model, with feedback between the economy and the pandemic, to allow for the trade-off between lives and livelihoods to vary by income.1 Empirical patterns are consistent with the model predictions under two, very reasonable, conditions: (a) poor countries are close to their subsistence constraint below which consumption cannot fall, and (b) the valuation of lives versus income is increasing in income which means that at the margin, poor countries value lives relative to income more than rich countries.

Our analysis starts from the model of Eichenbaum et al. (2021), henceforth ERT, in which agents expose themselves to infection risk?when working and consuming, and, realizing this danger, reduce economic activity as infection risk rises. However, they do not weigh the impact of their own labor and consumption decisions on the pandemic’s spread, creating an externality which the social planner seeks to internalize. The model allows for a policy lever in the form of a value-added tax on consumption, discouraging economic activity and hence slowing disease transmission. The policymaker chooses the tax to maximize the present value of aggregate utility, taking into account utility losses from both reduced consumption and lost lives.

We generalize ERT’s model by incorporating two features that may drive differences in optimal policy between countries at different income levels and with different fatality risk from COVID- a subsistence constraint, and varying values of a statistical life (VSL). First, to capture the intuition that poorer people may be less able to reduce their economic activity during the pandemic than richer counterparts, we introduce a subsistence constraint below which consumption cannot fall. Second, we also allow the trade-off between consumption and catching a potentially deadly infection to vary by income. That is, the VSL will always be lower in poorer countries, but the VSL-income ratio may not. Specifically, we allow the VSL to be a non-linear function of income and show that optimal policy depends crucially on the incomeelasticity of the VSL, as the social planner trades off risks of deaths against the utility of the living. We estimate both these parameters, i.e. the subsistence constraint and the income-elasticity of the VSL, using indirect inference. </s>"

The paper employs a generalized difference-in-differences approach to compare changes in political trust and political conflict before and after experiencing land expropriation with changes among individuals not experiencing expropriation during the same period.
The paper examines the political impacts of land expropriation in China, focusing on individuals' trust towards local government officials and conflicts with officials. It finds that land expropriation decreases political trust and increases the probability of conflicts, indicating political costs for the government. However, these impacts are not persistent and can be mitigated by sound local governance and public benefits from the projects. </s><s>Assistant: 
To quantify the political costs of land expropriation, I focus mainly on two outcomes: individuals’ trust towards local government officials (‘‘political trust’’) and whether individuals experienced conflicts with local government officials (‘‘political conflict’’). These two outcomes are important for several reasons. First, political trust is the foundation for political support and regime legitimacy (Newton et al., 2018). Second, both political trust and political conflict are critical to government efficiency, especially the effectiveness of policy implementation. For instance, Bargain and Aminjonov (2020) show that the compliance with public health policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in different European countries depends on the level of political trust prior to the crisis. Last but not least, using these two measures, this study investigates how both political attitudes and behavior are shaped by government expropriation. The political consequences of land expropriation identified in this paper also are informative for understanding the political situation in today’s China.

I construct a national individual-level panel data set from the CFPS with more than 8,000 households and 25,000 individuals for the period 2010–2018, which enables me to exploit rich variation in China’s land expropriation. In the sample, I only include rural villages, i.e., those that have a village committee (Chinese: Cunweihui). This is to ensure that the control group include only households and individuals that have agricultural land and thus are ‘‘eligible’’ for treatment.7 This paper focuses on state expropriation of agricultural land of rural households not programs such as housing demolition that mostly occur in urban areas and typically provide much more generous compensation. In the data, land expropriation occurs at different periods for different households, I thus employ a generalized difference-in-differences approach that compares changes in individual’s political trust or political conflict before and after experiencing land expropriation with changes among individuals not experiencing expropriation during the same period. This identifies the treatment effects of land expropriation on the treated. </s>"

Therefore, we can trace changesin each ownership type to identify the effect of trade-induced competition. Following Lu and Yu (2015), our identification rests on the plausibly exogenous variation in industry competition levels driven by China’s accession to the WTO. As industries were required to reduce their tariffs?to a relatively uniform level, those with higher pre-accession tariffs experienced a larger tariff reduction than others. Correspondingly, firms in these industries faced a relatively larger competitive shock from increased imports.,67 Therefore, we can classify firms into different treatment intensities according to the industry tariffs before the accession and implement an identification strategy using a difference-in-differences design with granular fixed effects at the firm and region-year levels. </s>"

The transparency intervention leads to moderate improvements in knowledge and institutions but does not result in measurable improvements in WASH service provision, facility use, school attendance, or exam results. The intervention also has negative effects on WASH provision and use for female students. </s><s>Assistant: 
Using a randomized experiment focused on WASH services in 60 schools in rural Bangladesh, we evaluate the impacts of a transparency intervention comprising a deliberative multi-stakeholder workshop initiated with a community scorecard exercise. Following a pre-specified analysis plan, we trace out the full causal path via which the intervention could affect outcomes of interest: changes in knowledge and institutions, improvements to WASH facilities, changes in use patterns in WASH facilities, school attendance, and exam results.2 We find that the intervention leads to moderate improvements in knowledge and institutions but not to measurable improvements in other outcomes.

Many schoolchildren in Bangladesh lack access to adequate WASH facilities, potentially increasing water-borne disease and absenteeism (UNICEF, 2012). Before our intervention, two schools in this study ?had no functioning toilets available to students. Those schools that did have functioning toilets had only one for every 226 students, far below the internationally recommended minimum standard of 50 (Water Aid, 2016). Only 61% of functioning toilets were clean and could be locked. No school had any toilet meeting the minimum requirements for safe and private menstrual hygiene management (MHM). Students and teachers reported that inadequate sanitation facilities affected female student attendance.

We randomly assigned 30 schools to receive the intervention we study. Developed by the Water Integrity Network (WIN) and the IRC International Water and Sanitation Centre, the Annotated Water Integrity Scan (AWIS) is a participatory assessment tool designed to gather and disseminate information, improve governance, and promote integrity.3 Integrity is defined as a set of practices that impede corruption and promote respect for the rule of law. During a workshop, participants first anonymously score WASH service provision across indicators measuring transparency, accountability, and participation. Facilitators then reveal the anonymized scores. When scores differ across participants, facilitators invite them to discuss why, with the goal of understanding differences in opinions rather than defending individual positions. The output of this stage of the discussion is a single, unified set of scores. This process is designed to yield a common understanding of challenges with the goal of identifying concrete and specific priority actions for improvement during the last phase of the workshop. AWIS closely resembles one of a set of ‘‘exemplary transparency interventions’’ identified by Kosack and Fung (2014).4 </s>"

The paper applies a regression discontinuity (RD) design focusing on close elections in Brazilian municipalities to identify the causal effects of female leaders on violence against women.
The paper provides evidence that the presence of a female mayor in Brazilian municipalities is associated with a significant reduction in domestic violence against women. The analysis shows a 50% reduction in femicide and other measures of violence against women, without observing an impact on the total number of homicides. </s><s>Assistant: 
Identifying the causal effects of female leaders on violence is challenging because there could be municipality characteristics that correlate with the likelihood of having a female leader and violence against women. Therefore, we apply a regression discontinuity (RD) design focusing on close elections in Brazilian municipalities (2004–2016), assuming that municipalities where a female candidate won against a man by a narrow margin represent a good counterfactual for those municipalities where the opposite occurred (i.e., a male candidate won against a woman by a narrow margin) (Barbosa, 2017, Lee et al., 2004). </s>"

The paper uses a difference-in-differences (DD) model, exploiting the timing of state-level implementation of female political seat reservations and the birth order of children.
The paper explores whether increasing the number of female leaders in rural India can reduce sex selection. It argues that improving the status of women within society can reduce son preference and lead to a decrease in sex ratios. </s><s>Assistant: 
Similar to Iyer et al. (2012) and Ghani et al. (2014), the methodology used in this paper also relies on the timing of state-level implementation of female political seat reservations. Exploiting variation both in the timing of when a state had its first Panchayat elections (effectively the first time seats for women were reserved) and in the birth order of children, I estimate a difference-in-differences (DD) model. The model investigates birth order-specific effects because sex selection is known to increase disproportionately at higher birth orders.3 Prior to female seat reservations, my sample consists of 117 boys per 100 girls at birth orders 3 and greater, 107 boys per 100 girls at the second birth order, and 106 boys per 100 girls at the first birth order. I find that higher birth order children born in rural India following a Panchayat election that reserved seats for women are less likely to be male, while there is no evidence that sex ratios changed for second and first-born children. The estimates imply that post-reservations, there are between 6 to 12 fewer boys per 100 girls at birth orders 3 and greater in rural India. These effects are large and imply an increased survival of approximately 900,000 to 1,800,000 high birth order girls over the course of the study. </s>"

The paper uses a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design focusing on mixed-gender races to identify the effect of electing a female mayor on COVID-19 outcomes. It also employs a dynamic local difference-in-difference approach using quarterly data to estimate the effect of electing a female mayor on hospitalizations and deaths caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) in municipalities.
The paper examines the role of female leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. It finds that municipalities led by women had fewer COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations per 100 thousand inhabitants. Female leaders were more likely to adopt non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mandatory use of face masks and restrictions on gatherings. The effects of female leadership were stronger in municipalities where voters were more supportive of the populist president who denied the severity of the crisis. </s><s>Assistant: 
Identifying the effects of female leaders on policy outcomes is challenging because of municipality-specific factors that are related both to the presence of female leaders and the outcomes. To avoid biases caused by these factors, we implement a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design focusing on mixed-gender races. This method allows us to identify the effect of electing a female mayor on COVID-19 outcomes by comparing municipalities where a female candidate won against a male one by a narrow margin with the ones where the opposite occurred. To provide complementary evidence on our findings we estimate the effect of electing a female mayor using a dynamic local difference-in-difference approach using quarterly data and compare hospitalizations and deaths caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) in municipalities with male and female mayors relatively to the figures before the COVID-19 outbreak.

We perform a series of robustness checks. First, we document very similar point estimates using SARI deaths and hospitalizations as dependent variables, which are less likely to suffer from non-classical measurement error caused by strategic under reporting since they do not depend on a positive COVID-19 test for a diagnosis. Second, our point estimates are very similar using linear and quadratic RD polynomials and different bandwidths.1 Third, our estimates using a local difference-in-difference comparing changes in SARI outcomes before and after the pandemic outbreak in municipalities with males and females mayors provide qualitatively similar results. </s>"

The identification strategy used in this paper is to compare the outcomes before and after a change in the percentage of women in the Executive Committees (ECs) of Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) in Nepal. This change occurred in 2009 when the government set a minimum threshold of 50 percent female representation in the ECs.
The core story of this paper is to analyze the impact of increased female participation in decision-making bodies of local collective action institutions on forest protection, specifically the quantity of firewood collected by households in Nepal. The paper argues that women have different and complementary interests in forest management compared to men, and their increased representation can lead to better forest conservation and equity in the distribution of benefits. </s><s>Assistant: 
To account for the potential endogeneity of female representation I exploit the fact that in groups formed after 2009, the percentage of women in the Executive Committees is higher than in groups formed before and compare the outcome before and after this change, as an identification strategy. The results show that higher female participation in the ECs of FUGs leads to a decrease in firewood extraction. This evidence is suggestive that women are prioritising conservation to ensure sustainable firewood extraction to satisfy their daily needs. </s>"

The paper uses a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) in mixed gender close electoral races to identify the effect of the gender of the mayor on policy outcomes.
The paper examines the impact of the gender of the policymaker on corruption in Brazilian municipalities. It finds that female mayors are less likely to be involved in administrative irregularities and receive fewer campaign contributions compared to male mayors. However, male mayors are more likely to be reelected due to their involvement in patronage and ability to attract more campaign donations. </s><s>Assistant: 
We contribute to this literature by providing novel evidence on the causal effect of the gender of the policymaker on corruption in the municipal administration using an Regression Discontinuity (RD) design. Instead of relying on survey measures of corruption, we use an objective measure of irregularities in government contracts and purchases based on random audits of local administrations. We find that female mayors are less likely to be involved in administrative irregularities. We also analyze gender differences along two other dimensions that may also be related to corrupt practices at the local level, which have not been explored before in the gender literature.1 First, we analyze employment in the municipal administration, which can provide some insights about the use of patronage. We find that male mayors tend to hire more temporary public employees during the electoral year, which is a standard way to engage in patronage in Latin America (Kemahlioglu, 2013). Second, we analyze gender differences in terms of campaign contributions. Political donations may allow private interests to gain influence over elected officials (Strauss, 1999, Ansolabehere, 2007) and the empirical evidence from Brazil shows that firms that contribute to the campaigns of winning candidates experience significant increases in government contracts (Boas et al., 2014). We find that women receive fewer campaign contributions than men, potentially consistent with our corruption results.

A key empirical challenge to identify the effect of the gender of the mayor on policy outcomes is that there may be municipality-specific factors that are correlated with both the gender of the mayor and policy outcomes. To control for municipality-specific confounding factors, we adopt a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) in mixed gender close electoral races. In this set-up, identification comes from comparing municipalities where a female candidate barely won an election against a male candidate with municipalities where the opposite occurred.9 Although this estimation strategy controls for municipality unobservable factors, it does not account for individual characteristics of the mayor. This could raise some concerns if male and female mayors differ in terms of individual characteristics that are relevant for policymaking.10 To alleviate this concern, common in the gender literature, we show that female and male mayors elected following close races are similar in terms of a wide range of observable characteristics, including education, political affiliation, and political experience. </s>"

The study uses a difference-in-differences identification strategy in a matched sample to analyze the long-term impact of the Soviet Union's aid program on Sino-Russian trade patterns. The strategy eliminates unobserved differences across Chinese cities and controls for overall trade volumes between foreign countries and China.
The paper examines the long-term effects of the Soviet Union's aid program, specifically the 156 Program, on contemporary Sino-Russian trade patterns. It proposes that aid can build social capital, such as affinity or trust, between donors and recipients, which facilitates long-term economic exchanges. The study provides empirical evidence and mechanisms to support this claim. </s><s>Assistant: Identifying the causal effect of aid on trade is challenging. The main difficulty comes from the non-random allocation of aid. In our context, however, the 156 Program chose the locations of aid projects according to explicit criteria (Bo, 1991). First, as the projects invested in heavy industries, regions with mineral resources and transportation capacity were prioritized. Second, to reduce spatial inequality, projects were more likely to be constructed in underdeveloped regions. Third, projects should be placed out of the reach of American bombers to enhance military security. We use a set of city-level variables to proxy for the site selection rules and match the recipient cities with control cities that have similar characteristics. To support that the selected control cities are a valid counterfactual for the recipient ones in the absence of aid, we compare the recipient and control cities across various variables that are untargeted in the matching procedure. We find insignificant differences between the two groups of cities in geographic, meteorologic, demographic, and political characteristics.

We then employ a difference-in-differences identification strategy in the matched sample. This compares contemporary Sino-Russian trade with the trade between China and countries other than Russia across Chinese cities with higher and lower aid intensity.4 In the main analysis, we measure city-level aid intensity by the total value of investment in the projects of the 156 Program. The DID strategy further eliminates all the unobserved differences across Chinese cities, which may correlate with aid intensity and affect trade with foreign countries. It also removes the differences in overall trade volumes between foreign countries and China. Combining the matching strategy and DID strategy, we thus interpret our empirical results as causal.

After establishing the association between aid and affinity, we adopt three approaches to demonstrate the potential of affinity in explaining the higher Sino-Russian trade in recipient cities. First, we follow the method proposed by Rauch (1999) and divide tradable goods into differentiated goods and non-differentiated goods. Heterogenous analysis suggests that Soviet aid only significantly increases Sino-Russian trade in differentiated goods, which rely more on trust during the transaction process. Second, Soviet aid decreases recipient cities' trade with countries ideologically opposite to the Soviet Union and increases trade with countries ideologically close to the Soviet Union. We interpret the finding as a salient prediction of the affinity mechanism. Third, the sudden withdrawal of Soviet experts in 1960 caused some projects in the 156 Program to be finished construction by China's own efforts. Specifically, the remaining construction was conducted during the split period when China launched anti-Soviet propaganda. We estimate the differential effects of the projects by project completion year and find that projects completed after the split yield negative effects on Sino-Russian trade. The finding is considered as evidence for the affinity mechanism from the other direction.6 We note that each single exercise is open to other interpretations, but these findings, derived from independent perspectives, can be collectively rationalized by the affinity mechanism. This leads us to believe in the importance of affinity in driving the Sino-Russian trade in recipient cities. Lastly, we lay out a discussion of other potential mechanisms, such as the persistence of industrial linkages and information. </s>"

The paper utilizes a spatial regression discontinuity (RD) design based on the historical Anglo-French border in Cameroon to identify the long-term impact of colonial practices on women's outcomes.
The paper examines the long-term effects of British and French colonial practices on female economic empowerment and intimate partner violence (IPV) in Cameroon. It finds that British colonial rule led to higher female employment and empowerment, but also increased IPV risk. The results suggest a male backlash effect, where men resort to violence when their partners' economic opportunities increase. </s><s>Assistant: This setting provides us with a unique opportunity to examine whether and how policies promoting female empowerment affect women's lives in the long-term. We focus on two questions: Did the divergent opportunities that opened up for women when Cameroon was split into a French and a British colony have a long-term impact on female participation in activities outside the household, especially in the labor market, that persists until today? Given that women's employment status has been linked to domestic violence in numerous settings worldwide, does Cameroon's colonial past continue to influence women's treatment within the household nowadays, especially in terms of intimate partner violence (henceforth, IPV)?

To get at these questions, we use the historical Anglo-French border in present day's Cameroon in a spatial regression discontinuity (RD) design. Our analysis draws upon two repeated cross sections (2004, 2011) of the Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), which contains geolocated household survey data and a domestic violence module, completed by one randomly selected woman per surveyed household. Because the validity of our spatial RD design rests on continuity of all factors besides treatment at the historical Anglo-French border, we match ethnic groups in the DHS with information on ancestral anthropological and cultural group characteristics from Murdock's Ethnographic Atlas. Specification checks show that these ancestral characteristics, some of which have been shown to correlate with women's current outcomes (Alesina et al. (2016)), do not vary across the historical Anglo-French border. We also provide evidence suggesting that selective migration across the treatment threshold poses no threat to identification. </s>"

The paper leverages the staggered implementation of inheritance reform across Indian states, as well as the availability of ultrasound technology and the sex of the firstborn child, to identify the causal effects of equal inheritance rights for women on the preference for sons.
The paper investigates whether equal inheritance rights for women in India modify the historic preference for sons. It explores the potential mechanisms through which equal inheritance rights may mellow the preference for sons, such as providing old-age security and reducing dowry costs. The paper finds that the inheritance reform increased female foeticide and son-biased fertility stopping behavior, indicating an intensification of son preference. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, we investigate this issue by modelling the sex ratio at birth as a function of whether the inheritance reform in the state of birth had been passed before the year of birth. To identify causal effects of equal inheritance rights for women, we leverage the staggered implementation of the inheritance reform across the Indian states, which created state and cohort-level variation in reform exposure, similar, for instance, to Miller (2008). We buttress this double difference using two further sources of variation that determine the degree of exposure to the reform. First, we interact the inheritance reform indicator with a cohort-varying indicator for availability of ultrasound technology. Previous work shows ultrasound availability generated a trend break in the sex ratio at birth (Bhalotra and Cochrane, 2010). We exploit the fact that prior to the introduction of ultrasound technology that made prenatal detection of the sex of the foetus feasible, no significant manipulation of the sex ratio at birth is discernible in aggregate statistics (Bhalotra and Cochrane, 2010). So, for the sex ratio at birth to have responded to the reform, the indicator for ultrasound access will need to have switched on. This aids identification because any omitted variables that drive a spurious relationship between the outcome variables and inheritance reform would have to have exhibited a discontinuous change that not only lines up with the particular state and year variation in reform (i.e. in the state of Kerala in 1976, in Andhra Pradesh in 1986 and so on) but, in addition, the omitted variables would have to have jumped in line with the date of introduction of ultrasound scans as well. Moreover, crossing the reform and ultrasound indicators helps us attribute any observed effects to parental manipulation of the sex ratio.

The final source of variation deployed towards identification is the sex of the firstborn child. Previous work shows that this is a) quasi-random and b) that it predicts sex-selective abortion in favour of male children: parents who, by the random hand of nature, are assigned a son at first birth are significantly less likely to engage in female foeticide for subsequent conceptions (see Almond et al. forthcoming; Almond and Edlund, 2008; Abrevaya, 2009; Bhalotra and Cochrane, 2010; Anukriti et al., 2016).3 We also show that families with firstborn sons and families with firstborn daughters are balanced on all relevant observable characteristics.

To summarize, the treated group is defined as a cohort born post-reform and post-ultrasound in a family with a firstborn daughter. The control group includes families with firstborn sons and children born pre-reform or pre-ultrasound. We corroborate our findings of changes in sex-selective abortion behaviour using data on reported son preference (i.e. desired share of sons among births). We conclude with an attempt to investigate whether passage of the reform was associated with changes in patriarchal norms, in particular, whether daughters married closer to the natal home, and whether adult sons changed their propensity to co-reside with parents. </s>"

The paper uses differences in the timing of the implementation of political reservations across Indian states to identify the impact on women's entrepreneurship.
The paper finds that the implementation of political reservations in India has led to a significant increase in women's entrepreneurship, but has not had a significant impact on women's employment in the manufacturing sector. </s><s>Assistant: We also see evidence of this entrepreneurship response when looking along state borders as to how long adjacent district pairs have been exposed to the reservations. This state border strategy helps with omitted concerns, but it is not a panacea for all potential identification challenges. The approach better controls for local differences in income, climate, culture, social norms, and demographics, for example, to the degree to which these factors are common between neighboring districts. Also, the approach requires that identification come through differential changes for states on one border versus another that are appropriately timed with the adoption of reservations. However, the approach may not isolate the impact of the reservations from other changes that states may have made with similar timing. Thus, if the political reservations were consistently bundled into a package of reforms implemented by states (e.g., alongside large independent investments in women's education), the border approach will not be able to differentiate the specific role of the reservations. </s>"

The study also shows that the policy is effective in reducing SO2 emissions and increasing labor productivity. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, we estimate the impact of a nationwide target-based air pollution control policy, the KCAPC policy, on the environmental performances and labor demands of firms using two firm-level datasets: China's Environmental Statistics Database (CESD) and China's Industrial Enterprise Database (CIED), as well as other sources at both the city level and individual-level. In the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP), 66 cities were designated as the second batch KCAPC and were thus required to show progress in improving the air quality of the city (see section 2 for detailed information). Since the KCAPC selection is not random, to alleviate the difference between treated cities and control cities, we first use PSM based on the pre-KCAPC attributes of the cities to select a statistically defensible comparison group from untreated cities. Then, we use a DID estimation to investigate how the KCAPC policy affected employment in the treated area compared with the untreated area. </s>"

Night lights data are potentially most valuable for developing countries, because richer countries often have other sources of information on local economic activity, including more conventional data such as sub-provincial (e.g. district or county) GDP estimates.

The paper aims to evaluate the impact of climate change on agricultural TFP and yield in China, and to identify the mechanisms of how climate change affects yield through its impact on TFP and input utilization. It also investigates the extent of longer-term adaptation offsets in agricultural losses. </s><s>Assistant: We combine the strength of existing literature to investigate the nonlinear relationship between agricultural TFPs and variation in temperature and other weather variables. This article follows two representative approaches introduced by Schlenker and Roberts (2009) in panel regressions: 1) a simple piecewise linear function of temperature and construct the variables of growing degree days (GDDs) below and above a selected threshold and 2) more specific temperature bins that calculate the accumulation of heat for each 3–6 ?°C temperature interval. The simultaneous variations in additional weather variables, such as rainfall, sunshine duration, humidity, and wind force are also taken into account (Zhang et al., 2017). Panel estimates suggest that piecewise linear function yields results similar to those estimated using more complicated functional forms. An increase in exposure to temperatures above 33 ?°C results in sharp declines in agricultural TFPs. We use the same methods to evaluate the impact of climate change on yield (measured by unit land output value) and find it to be more negative than the impact on agricultural TFP, as we expected, since extreme hot weather may also lower input utilization in the short run. Applying the same approach, we find evidence that labor and fertilizer usage is indeed significantly reduced with an increase in exposure to high temperature. </s>"

The paper uses a difference-in-difference strategy to examine the impact of green credit regulations on firms' external financial conditions.
The paper investigates the effect of green credit regulations on firms' economic and environmental performance, focusing on the loan costs and the adoption of pollution abatement technologies. </s><s>Assistant: 
Facilitated by a set of comprehensive firm-level loan data, we are able to perform these analyses. The loan data are provided by one of China's “Big Five” banks covering firms in 31 provinces with different credit ratings, sizes, ownership types and sectoral distributions. The data record detailed information about each loan issued to firms. Therefore, our analysis is about loaning to all firms rather than the loans with specific environmental ends. This study relates to how banks integrate firms' environmental risks into the loan issuing process when lending to dirty firms which is subject to the environmental laws and regulations.

In this research, we intend to find out how financial markets internalize the potential adverse cost of firm's environmental credit risk on the margins of a borrowing firm, and how the increased loan costs further affect firms' economic and environmental performance. To begin, we build a static model, in which firms can autonomously choose to abate the pollution or not. At the same time, in order to maximize their profits, banks choose the optimal float rate of loans over the benchmark interest rate set by the central bank. When the enforcement of green loan regulations is strengthened, banks increase their loan rates to firms without abatement. As a result, a new cutoff of firm productivity emerges for those indifferent to pollution abatement since firms without abatement will face greater financing cost. We derive several testable propositions from the model. First, more stringent green loan regulations induce large, incompliant firms to adopt abatement technologies and their loans are thus less impacted by the policy. However, for small firms that are still unwilling to improve their environmental performance, their loan cost will be substantially and positively affected. Second, in regard to the economic performance, the negative impact of the green credit policy on firms' sales and investments is stronger for small nonabatement firms. Third, when it comes to the environmental performance, although all of these firms have reduced their pollution emissions, this effect is stronger for large firms. Furthermore, only large non-abatement firms decrease their pollution by investing in abatement technology.

To test these predictions, we construct a rich firm-level dataset. We draw from multiple sources: firm-level economic data from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF); bank loan data from one of China's five largest state-owned commercial banks; firm-level pollution data from the Annual Environmental Survey of Polluting Firms (AESPF); and firms' environmental penalty data from the Dataset on Environmental Penalty. The merged dataset contains information on 130,000 unique firm loans, accounting for approximately half of the total loan value issued to manufacturing firms by banks and covering firms with different credit ratings in all provinces, firms of differing sizes and ownership characteristics, and firms operating in different sectors. </s>"

The study uses a difference-in-differences (DD) method and a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) framework to estimate the effects of fuel standards on air pollution in China.
The study finds that the enforcement of more stringent fuel standards in China significantly improved air quality, with an average reduction of 12.9% in pollution levels. The study also highlights the importance of local government efforts and the net benefits of adopting the new gasoline standard. </s><s>Assistant: 
The study's analyses exploit a compelling quasi-experiment: changes in standards for fuel sold in Chinese cities. According to official statistics from China's Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), exhaust from motor vehicles contributes a quarter to a third of particulate matter (PM) air pollution throughout the country (MEP, 2013). Against this background, since 2013 China has gradually tightened its gasoline standards, followed by diesel standards upgrading in certain cities. The introduction of low-sulfur fuel has aimed at reducing emissions from the motor vehicle fleet substantially, and the regulations need to be strictly enforced by the retailers.

The study's analyses involve merging data on prefecture-level regulations with hourly pollution data from 1492 air quality monitoring stations in 337 prefectures for the three years 2013–2015. In addition to the air quality index (AQI), a composite measure of pollution, data on suspended particulates less than 10 μm in diameter (PM10) and less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and on ozone (O3) concentrations are analyzed. Those pollutants are particularly related to fuel composition, and are among the most harmful to human health. This then marks the first time that high-quality data on fine particulates and ozone have been used to research Chinese environmental issues (Pope and Dockery, 2013).

We focus on precisely estimating the effect on air pollution of the first change in gasoline standards implemented during the period studied. Two estimation strategies are applied. In the first, both temporal and geographic variations in the implementation of the new gasoline standard are exploited to identify its effects. The empirical analysis compares daily changes in the local concentrations of air pollutants between prefectures implementing the new standard earlier (the treatment group) and later (the control group). The validity of the difference-in-differences (DD) methods applied and the causal interpretation of the results rely on the assumption that prefectures that adopted the new standard later are proper counterfactuals for what would have happened to earlier adopters in the absence of the change. A large number of other variables are included in the analyses, including monitoring station fixed effects, day fixed effects, station-specific seasonality, weather conditions, fuel prices and subsequent changes in fuel quality standards. It is also necessary to remove the confounding influence of other on-going policies aimed at curbing air pollution by directly controlling for them. To further address the selected nature of the enforcement dates, we control for the differences in the trends in outcomes between early adopters and later ones depending on the key determinants in the timing of the fuel standard changes (i.e., the historical pollution level and growth), a technique used by Gentzkow (2006). Beyond that, a series of robustness tests verify that the treatment and control prefectures are comparable in terms of their pre-regulation trends in the outcomes.

The study's second set of analyses follows the lead of work by Davis (2008) and by Auffhammer and Kellogg (2011) and the review by Hausman and Rapson (2018). A regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) framework is applied to identify the effect of gasoline standards on air pollution. After the new regulations came into force, all the retailers in the treatment prefectures were assumed to have immediately switched to supplying only gasoline meeting the new standards. That is assumed to have created a discontinuity in tailpipe emissions. In effect, the abrupt change makes other factors smooth on the day of implementation of the new regulations, so the day just before the new regulations can serve as a good counterfactual to the day the new regulations came into force. To validate concerns about causal identifications in the RDiT context, serial correlation in the daily pollutant data is evaluated to recover both the short-run and long-run policy effects. In addition, a number of auxiliary sensitivity checks provide reassuring results. </s>"

The paper employs a generalized difference-in-differences (DID) approach with multiple treatments over time to compare the levels of democracy in island countries with and without storms. The identification strategy relies on the fact that storms are exogenous shocks, striking randomly in terms of timing and intensity.
The paper explores the emergence of 'storm autocracies', where governments become more autocratic in exchange for providing relief assistance following major storms. The citizens accept this autocracy as a means of avoiding potential insurgencies. The study highlights the dynamics behind this political equilibrium and its implications for democratic conditions. </s><s>Assistant: Next, we provide empirical evidence of how storm shocks can result in autocratic tendencies. Our focus on a natural shock provides a plausibly exogenous source of variation for what is otherwise a highly endogenous and convoluted political equilibrium determined by historical, economic, and cultural factors. We use extensive cross-country panel data observed annually from 1950 to 2020, which exhibits significant country-by-year variation in storm presence and intensity, to estimate the reduced form relationship between storm shocks and the level of democracy in a natural-experimental setting. In so doing, we exploit an underlying geographic characteristic, namely storms in islands, as a natural experiment.5 Our setting is intended to capture the random variation in the timing (i.e., the year of incidence) and intensity (i.e., their frequency as well as physical severity) of storm exposure in affected island countries compared with their storm-free counterparts.

An additional empirical advantage of storms in islands relates to the full exposure of the island constituency to the treatment. As disasters rarely affect a country's entire territorial space, it is generally challenging to determine their average treatment effect on a national outcome, such as the level of democracy.6 Island countries help to address this pitfall, in that major storms tend to traverse a large part of their territories, especially for relatively small islands such as Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Fiji. This results in a large constituency being exposed, or ‘treated’, thus making such islands a viable cluster for unmasking the average treatment effect on the national outcome of interest.

We employ a generalized difference-in-differences (DID) approach with multiple treatments over time to compare the levels of democracy in island countries with and without storms. The validity of our identification strategy relies on the evidence that many island countries are victims of major storms (most notably, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Haiti, and Madagascar experience severe storms regularly), while several others are spared storms due to their geographic locations (e.g., Iceland and Singapore experienced no storms between 1950 and 2020).

We account for unobserved heterogeneity in the storm–polity nexus by relying on the fact that storms are exogenous shocks: they strike randomly in terms of both timing and intensity. Even if politicians expect storms in a given year based on a country's storm history, they cannot predict their frequency or severity in that year. The triggering factors of storms—e.g., wind patterns and the ocean surface temperature—are hardly predictable in the medium- and long-term: a storm typically originates in the ocean due to variations in its surface temperature, and its route is determined by the wind speed and direction. These factors are exogenous to both economic and political outcomes.

We achieve comparability between storm-prone and storm-free countries by accounting for an array of permanent differences across countries through controlling for country-fixed effects. We also control for year-fixed effects to help neutralize any shocks experienced by all countries. Moreover, we isolate the long-term path of political conditions (which might be driven, for example, by countries’ locations or colonial history) by controlling for country-specific linear time trends. Once time-invariant country differences, year-fixed effects, and country-specific trends are all controlled for, the two country groups become reasonably comparable, at least initially, and the remaining variation in the model is likely to yield a credible average treatment effect of storms. </s>"

The paper uses a difference-in-difference research design to identify the effects of maize on precolonial Africa. It compares outcomes from countries with large amounts of maize-suitable land to outcomes from countries with small amounts of maize-suitable land, before and after maize was introduced into Africa.
The paper examines the effects of crop movements during the Columbian Exchange on precolonial Africa, specifically focusing on the introduction of maize. It tests the Crosby-Curtin Hypothesis that suggests maize increased both population density and slave exports in Africa. The paper finds robust evidence supporting this hypothesis. </s><s>Assistant: While the population effects of maize envisioned by Crosby and Curtin follow directly from the Malthusian forces present in Africa during the Columbian Exchange, the link to slavery is less obvious. As such, the first step in our analysis is to develop a simple theoretical framework to illustrate how these same Malthusian forces may have also increased slave exports. Our starting point for this exercise is the Malthusian growth model featuring endogenous slavery developed by Lagerlof (2009). This model is well suited for our purposes; as highlighted by Fenske (2013), the Lagerlof (2009) model matches several key stylized facts about African societies during the Columbian Exchange. In the original Lagerlof framework, ruling political elites choose property rights for land and labor to maximize their payoff, and the incentive to enslave people to work in agriculture is increasing in the productivity of land. We adapt this framework to allow for the possibility that the elites sell slaves to foreign markets. This alters the effects of an increase in agricultural productivity; while the elite's incentive to keep slaves to work in domestic agriculture increases, decreasing returns to agriculture mean that the relative return to exporting slaves also increases. Thus, an agricultural productivity shock, such as that created by the introduction of New World Crops, will increase both the population density of and slave exports from an affected country.

The second step in our analysis is to test the predictions of the Crosby-Curtin Hypothesis empirically. We start by examining which New World crops, if any, could have created the change in agricultural productivity envisioned by Crosby and Curtin. Such a crop needs to satisfy three conditions. First, it must have had enough calories and nutrients to function as a primary dietary source. Second, it must have had a higher yield than existing African staples, so its adoption would have resulted in an increase in agricultural productivity. Finally, it must have been introduced and widely adopted in Africa in the midst of the slave trades.

Many New World crops were introduced into Africa following Columbus's discovery of the Americas, but only maize (Zea mays) satisfies these three conditions. Maize first arrived on the African coast during the seventeenth century. It was initially introduced by the Portuguese to supply their trading forts, but the crop was quickly adopted by African farmers due to its high energy yield, its low labor requirements, and its short growing season. Cultivation spread quickly; as we discuss below, the available historical evidence indicates that maize was grown across much of the African continent by the early 1700s. Given its characteristics and the timing of its introduction, maize is the most likely cause of any agricultural productivity shock. Hence, we focus our attention on maize.

While maize is the most likely source of an agricultural productivity shock, we do not observe the specific dates it was adopted due to the incomplete historical record. To address this challenge we exploit cross-country differences in geographic characteristics and the timing of the crop's introduction into Africa to identify the effects of maize.4 Our approach relies on the fact that while maize diffused rapidly across the African continent after its introduction in the mid-seventeenth century, it could not be grown everywhere due to differences in time invariant geo-climatic conditions. This means that only the subset of countries that were suitable for the cultivation of maize could have been affected (or “treated”) by the crop when it was introduced into Africa. Hence, testing the Crosby-Curtin Hypothesis amounts to identifying the effects of maize on this group of countries. To do so, we adopt a variant of a simple difference-in-difference research design that compares outcomes from countries with large amounts of maize-suitable land to outcomes from countries with small amounts of maize-suitable land, before and after maize was introduced into Africa. This approach allows us to control for time-invariant country characteristics, such as geography, as well as continent-wide trends such as ongoing technological change and changes in the global demand for slaves, that would otherwise confound identification. We implement this design using a country-level panel data set that contains information on population levels between 1000 and 1900, slave exports between 1400 and 1800, the suitability of maize as a crop, and several other country characteristics. </s>"

The identification strategy used in this paper is a difference-in-differences (DD) method, controlling for key determinants in the selection of PMC counties. The sample is restricted to PMC counties and a placebo test is conducted by randomly assigning the adoption of PMC reforms to counties. An event study is also used to estimate year-wise changes in economic performance before and after the PMC reform.
The core story of this paper is to examine the impact of flattening government hierarchies on economic performance in China. The study focuses on the PMC reform, which aims to relieve financial strain on county-level governments, improve administrative efficiency, and stimulate local economic growth. The analysis finds that the adoption of PMC reforms reduces a county's GDP per capita and does not significantly improve social welfare. </s><s>Assistant: Our analysis proceeds in three stages. We first investigate the link between the PMC reform and a county's economic performance. Specifically, do PMC counties experience higher or lower per capita GDP over time? Then, to support a causal interpretation of our findings, we shed light on the channels through which the PMC system might influence economic performance. Specifically, what is the nature of the reform—does it involve simply the removal of one layer in the fiscal hierarchy, with authority moved from prefectures to provinces, or does it also involve subtle changes in revenue and expenditure assignment among various layers of government? If the former, does the flattening on average improve a county's fiscal revenue and inter-governmental transfers—the goals of the reform? How does increased span of control impact the upper-level government's ability to coordinate and monitor spending and land sales? Third, we examine how the PMC reform affects other economic outcomes, such as household income, consumption, and inequality.

The analysis involves constructing a novel data set from a large number of official sources. The data cover 1809 counties between 1995 and 2012. They contain very detailed information not only about GDP, fiscal revenue, transfers and expenditure, but also about changes in government organization. For each county, we measure the change in organizational structure with: (1) a PMC reform indicator, and (2) the span of control of the county government's supervising body. Such comprehensive panel data allow for an examination of China's county economies before and after the PMC reform, and the mechanism underlying such impacts.

The key challenge in identifying the effect of PMC reforms is selecting appropriate control groups for the treatment group. The validity of the difference-in-differences (DD) methods applied and the causal interpretation of the results rely on the assumption that non-PMC counties and counties that adopted PMC later are valid counterfactuals for what would have happened to earlier adopters in the absence of the PMC reform. However, the reformed counties are not randomly selected. To address the identification challenge, we control for the differences in the trends in outcomes between PMC counties and non-PMC counties depending on the key determinants in the selection of PMC counties, a strategy used by Gentzkow (2006). Beyond that, we restrict the sample to PMC counties, increasing confidence in the comparability of the treated and control groups. We also conduct a placebo test by randomly assigning the adoption of PMC reforms to counties. Finally, we use an event study to estimate year-wise changes in economic performance before and after the PMC reform with a window of eight years. </s>"

The paper uses a quasi-random assignment of areas close to historical transportation networks in China to examine the causal effect of access to transportation infrastructure on economic performance.
The paper investigates the impact of access to transportation infrastructure on economic outcomes in different regions in China during a period of rapid growth. It examines whether better access to transportation enriches or impoverishes regions and whether areas with better access serve as engines of growth when new economic opportunities arise. </s><s>Assistant: This paper makes progress in understanding the impact of access to transportation infrastructure by examining the causal effect of access on economic performance in different regions in China during a twenty-year period of rapid growth. We ask the straightforward question: do areas that are “quasi-randomly” assigned to have better access to transportation networks consequently have better economic outcomes in the long run? Specifically, we attempt to empirically examine two closely related questions. First, we ask whether access to better transportation enriches the average region that is affected (because it draws in or generates more new economic activities) or impoverishes it (because it becomes easier for human and physical capital to exit). Second, we ask whether areas that have better access to transportation networks benefit much more and serve as engines of growth when new economic opportunities arise and growth becomes possible after 1979. //提出问题

For our discussion, it is important to keep three points in mind. First, our focus is on long term effects. We are not only interested in the impact on trade and prices that result from greater access, which tend to be relatively quick, but also in the subsequent changes in the patterns of localization of economic activity as people and factories relocate. Second, the emphasis on understanding the effect of infrastructure for the average location is crucial to our study since it is entirely possible that some of the largest cities benefit from infrastructure through greater concentration of resources while most other places lose out. Finally, there cannot be one definitive answer to these questions, since the answer will clearly depend on the starting point – i.e., the first road to connect the agricultural hinterland to a port is very different from the fifth such road. //

We use county-level economic data from China to try to answer these questions. In many ways, China offers an ideal setting for our work. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Chinese government and a set of Western colonial powers built railroads connecting the historical cities of China to each other and to the newly constructed “Treaty Ports”.2 We identify our average “treated” areas to be those that were close to the straight line connecting this set of cities. Our analysis excludes the terminal cities, where there are obviously confounding effects. Our strategy is to first compare areas closer to the lines to areas further away and show that they have on average better infrastructure. We then compare various measures of economic outcomes further and closer to the line and interpret any difference in economic outcomes as the overall effect of any transportation infrastructure – the original railroads and any other infrastructure later added – along these historical transportation corridors.

This strategy has a number of advantages. First, it provides us with an exogenous source of variation in access to transportation networks. Second, this variation goes back to at least fifty years before our study begins in 1986, by which time the patterns of economic activity would have had ample chance to relocate. We can therefore ask what the long run level effect of being close to the line (and hence to transportation) was, say around 1986. Third, our study period, 1986–2006, coincides with China's opening up and subsequent growth acceleration. Our treatment areas were plausibly in a good position to take the lead in exploiting these new opportunities, exporting to the rest of the world, using their access, although they could also export their resources to the terminal cities, which would have the opposite effect. We therefore also study growth effects of being close to the line over the period 1986–2003.

However, there is an alternative and complementary interpretation under which the measured benefits of infrastructure are small even if better transportation causes substantial gains to overall GDP. The basic idea emphasizes the role of factor mobility. Under full labor and capital mobility, wages and incomes would be equalized in our treatment and control areas even if there are large macro effects and we would see no difference in their outcomes. Of course, the assumption of full factor mobility is clearly inconsistent with the institutional conditions in China. In the paper, we present a simple model which shows that we can observe similar patterns with limited factor mobility. Specifically, if labor mobility is very limited, but capital is also relatively immobile compared to goods, and its mobility depends on the distance to transportation infrastructure, more remote areas may actually retain more of their capital compared to better connected areas (where all the resources move to the nearest metropolitan center). For the latter reason, GDP per capita may not dramatically decline in remote areas. Moreover, this effect only tells us about the level of GDP. As far growth is concerned, since even the more remote locations retain a substantial part of their resources, they also retain the possibility of participating in and benefitting from the exposure to global markets that raised the growth rate everywhere in China. Therefore, the impact on the growth rate, starting at a lower level, can be similar in remote and less remote areas. We summarize this intuition in the body of the paper and provide a formal discussion in the Appendix. </s>"

The paper investigates the long-run impacts of Christian missionary expansion on FGC in Africa.

The empirical results suggest that historical missions had a significant and persistent impact on reducing FGC practices. </s><s>Assistant: This paper investigates the long-run impacts of Christian missionary expansion on FGC in Africa. We ask whether people living in areas close to historical Christian missions are less likely to undergo FGC. We also explore potential underlying mechanisms.

To investigate and control for potential selection in the location of missions, we use ethnographic data on FGC in pre-colonial times from Ericksen (1989) - which we link to respondents by their ethnicity or by matching geographically to traditional regions of residence of ethnic groups (ethnic homelands) - and a large set of geographic and ethnic homeland control variables. </s>"

The paper uses six different measures of intergenerational mobility in education to address methodological challenges and evaluate mobility in different ways.
The paper finds that intergenerational mobility in education is lower in developing countries compared to high-income countries. There is a convergence in mobility when using measures sensitive to changes in education inequality, but a divergence when using measures invariant to changes in inequality. There is a monotonically increasing relationship between mobility and national income for inequality-sensitive measures, while inequality-invariant measures show a U-shape pattern. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest mobility despite low levels of parental education. The world as a whole is less mobile than the average country in it, with a modest upward trend in global mobility. Girls are catching up to boys in intergenerational mobility in developing countries. </s><s>Assistant: Our Global Database on Intergenerational Mobility (GDIM) significantly expands the evidence base on intergenerational mobility in education – and makes it possible, for the first time, to paint a truly global picture of intergenerational mobility.1 This in turn allows us to test whether insights from the existing literature, which has mostly focused on developed countries, generalize to developing countries. We focus on mobility in education for two reasons.2 First, intergenerational data on education is more widely available than on income. Second, unlike income, the level of education does not change once acquired, meaning that it is unlikely to introduce a lifecycle bias when elicited at a point in time (Nybom and Jan, 2016). A limitation of focusing on education mobility is that it does not capture distortions in the labor market, such as the extent to which access to good jobs is contingent on the parental background one is born into.

Measuring intergenerational mobility in education is subject to several methodological challenges, namely that educational outcomes are bounded below, bounded above, and exhibit bunching. Six different measures of intergenerational mobility are considered that address these challenges in different ways. Specifically, we evaluate: for respondents born to parents in the bottom half of the education distribution, (1) the probability that respondents reach the top quartile and (2) the expected educational rank within their generation (see e.g., Asher et al., 2019), (3) the share of respondents with a completed primary education conditional on neither parent having completed primary education (see e.g., Alesina et al., 2021), (4) 1 minus the correlation coefficient between respondents' and parents’ years of schooling as well as (5) 1 minus the corresponding regression coefficient (see e.g., Hertz et al., 2007; Neidh?fer et al., 2018), and (6) the share of respondents that managed to surpass their parents in terms of education.3 </s>"

The paper uses a nested-CES model of labor demand to estimate the consequences of migrant downgrading for native wages across the education distribution. It incorporates occupational downgrading into the estimation to directly quantify the effect of migrant downgrading on native wages. An instrumental variable strategy based on historical settlement patterns of Venezuelans is used to address potential endogeneity.
The paper examines the consequences of migrant occupational downgrading for native wages in Colombia, focusing on the influx of Venezuelan migrants during the economic and political crisis. It explores how migrant downgrading may increase inequality and hinder economic growth in the host country. The study aims to provide insights into the impact of forced displacement on the Colombian economy. </s><s>Assistant: Using geographic variation in migrant arrival across 79 metropolitan areas, I estimate a CES model of labor demand that is nested by education level and migration status. Following the literature, I estimate the elasticity of substitution between migrants and natives using variation in the migrant–native ratios of wages and labor supplies across metro areas and years (Ottaviano and Peri, 2012, Manacorda et al., 2012, Card, 2009). Intuitively, a low sensitivity of the migrant–native wage ratio to an increase in migrant labor supply within an education group implies a high migrant–native substitutability. This requires the identification assumption that migrant locational sorting into metro areas is uncorrelated with the potential migrant–native wage ratio, distinct from the traditional assumption that locational sorting is uncorrelated with potential wages. To account for the possibility that this assumption is violated, I use an instrumental variable strategy based on the historical settlement patterns of Venezuelans (Altonji and Card, 1991, Card, 2001), and the similarity of OLS and 2SLS coefficients indicates that there is little migrant locational sorting according to this wage ratio. I also use internal migration data to confirm that results are not biased by native spatial arbitrage (Borjas, 2003, Borjas and Katz, 2007, Monras, 2020). </s>"

The author investigates the parameters that explain whether a polling center is covered by the TV signal in 2017 and conducts placebo tests to ensure exogeneity in signal reception.
The paper examines the effect of exposure to TV during the electoral crisis in Kenya in 2017 on voters' behavior. It finds that TV had a significant impact on voter turnout in the repeat election, with a positive effect on supporters of the incumbent President and a negative effect on supporters of the opposition. TV exposure had no significant effect on involvement in electoral protests. </s><s>Assistant: To analyze the impact of TV on voters, I use a novel dataset on the staggered introduction of digital television in Kenya between 2013 and 2018. According to the Communication Authority of Kenya, more than 2,500 sublocations benefited from the migration from analog to digital television: this corresponds to approximately 7,000 polling stations that benefited from the expansion of the signal over the period. One challenge involved in estimating the causal impact of TV on mobilization comes from the risk of endogeneity due to plausible non-randomness in signal expansion. TV transmitters could have been installed in strategic locations – to maximize the number of receivers for instance –, and the voters with access to the signal might show specific political attitudes.

To overcome this risk of bias, I first investigate the parameters that explain whether a polling center is covered by the signal in 2017, and exhibit exogenous variation in the likelihood of receiving the signal. I construct a geo-coded dataset of Kenyan polling centers and TV transmitters and compute the fourth polynomial of the distance between each voting center and the nearest transmitter. The dataset also includes terrain ruggedness measures, distances to the capital or urban centers, urbanization status as well as demographic and economic covariates, measured at a fine-grained level. In line with the existing literature (Olken, 2009, Yanagizawa-Drott, 2014, Miner, 2015), I find that the distance to the transmitter and terrain features are the main predictors of signal reception. To capture the causal effect of exposure to TV, I rely on the identification assumption that locations with or without access to TV in 2017 are similar in unobserved characteristics, conditional on observables. I run a series of placebo tests to ascertain exogeneity in signal reception controlling for the determinants of signal propagation. I find that conditional on signal predictors, political preferences before 2013, and ethnic belongings, are not significantly correlated with TV reception in 2017. I run similar checks on economic and social covariates – before and at the time of the election – and do not find evidence of bias in the allocation of TV, conditional on the propagation determinants.

Then, I focus on two outcomes of interest as illustrative of the possible reactions to the institutional crisis: voters may decide to exit and not turn out or show their loyalty to their leader, or chose to voice their discontent by taking to the streets. I estimate the impact of access to TV on turnout for both the first and the recall election, and on occurrence of protests between the two elections, where the treated polling centers are those with access to the signal between 2013 and 2017, controlling for the signal predictors previously identified. Turnout dropped from 79% to 41% between the two elections because of the decrease in the remobilization rate among the opposition’s supporters but possibly also because of the lack of information provided to the voters about the new election taking place. </s>"

The results indicate that male upper-secondary general education graduates do not have an advantage in terms of employment probability or wages compared to vocational education graduates. </s><s>Assistant: Our study stands out from existing studies that evaluate the causal impact of general versus vocational education for four reasons. First, it extends the limited causal evidence on the impact of general versus vocational education in developing countries. Therefore, this is the first study to apply an RDD based on test scores to account for the nonrandom selection of students into tracks. We exploit a cutoff in the scores of an end-of-preparatory-school (9th grade) exam that tracks students in upper-secondary vocational or general education in Egypt. In this exam, students must score at least 70 points to be eligible for general upper-secondary education (Assaad, 2010, Assaad and Krafft, 2015a). We address selection into either the vocational or general education track based on the assumption that the exam scores cannot be manipulated. Therefore, we assume that the units just below and above the cutoff are comparable. To account for non-compliance in the assignment to upper-secondary general education, we employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (FRDD). Second, no other experimental or quasi-experimental study analyzes the impact of general versus vocational education in Egypt.5 Third, we estimate the long-term impacts of general versus vocational education approximately 17 years after program exit. In addition to our study, only Dai and Martins (2020) analyze the long-term effects of vocational versus general education in developing countries.6 Fourth, besides investigating the effect of general versus vocational education on labor market integration in terms of employment probability, we also evaluate its impact on three measures of employment quality: wages for those in wage employment, the probability of public-sector employment, and formal employment in the private sector. Analyzing employment quality is particularly important in developing countries, where under-employment and working conditions are often more critical than unemployment (Fields, 2004). Using data from two waves of the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS) for 2012 (OAMDI, 2019) and 2018 (OAMDI, 2020), we restrict our estimation sample to all men aged 25–49 who have taken the end-of-preparatory-school exam, passed it with scores ranging from 50 to 100, and continued on to complete upper-secondary education. Our sample also includes men who completed post-secondary or tertiary education (general or vocational), which represents one mechanism by which general upper-secondary education can affect labor market outcomes. While we acknowledge the important role of women in the Egyptian labor market, we exclude them from our analysis as female labor force participation in Egypt is low and there is selection into the labor market based on religious and cultural norms (Krafft, 2018, Hendy, 2015). </s>"

The paper provides empirical evidence and anecdotal examples to support this argument. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, we revisit an episode of a market transition from legal to illegal and investigate how illegality affects modern slavery. We exploit the complete shutdown of the mahogany market by the Brazilian government in the late 90 s using a quasi-experimental research design that takes advantage of the natural variation in the occurrence of mahogany trees in Brazilian municipalities as a treatment indicator. Our difference-in-differences estimates indicate that the transition of the mahogany market to illegal activity increased the likelihood of labor inspections uncovering slave labor in municipalities within the mahogany area. Event-study specifications provide assurance that the treatment variables do not merely reflect any preexisting dynamics of slave labor in mahogany regions. Our results are robust across different specifications and alternative measures of contemporary slavery, thereby enhancing the reliability of the baseline estimates. To address the possibility that labor inspections may have been coordinated to target specific locations following the law change, we rely on the fact that all of the police operations in the sample originated from local complaints rather than independent police investigations/intelligence. In addition, we show that the effects on the number of enslaved workers start to increase two years prior to the effect on the number of labor inspections, suggesting that we are measuring alterations in slavery prevalence rather than just changes in enforcement. </s>"

The identification strategy in this paper is to elicit and analyze farmers' willingness-to-pay for a soil test in a modified public goods game across villages with varying soil heterogeneity.

The core story of this paper is to establish the relationship between soil heterogeneity and investment in learning among farmers in Central Malawi. The paper examines the role of soil heterogeneity in farmers' willingness to pay for a soil test, and explores the cooperative behavior within soil-type groups. The findings suggest that farmer perceptions of soil similarity and the size of soil-type groups influence individual contributions, and that villages with more soil types have higher average contributions. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, we establish the relationship between soil heterogeneity and investment in learning among farmers in Central Malawi. This is a region with limited access to agricultural extension services, government or otherwise (Knorr et al., 2007), and, as we will show for our sample, varying degrees of soil heterogeneity.
We study investment in learning among smallholder farmers by eliciting and analyzing their willingness-to-pay for a soil test in a modified public goods game across villages with varying soil heterogeneity. In our experiment, farmers are allowed to cooperate or to free ride on each others’ investments. We use collective contributions towards a soil test in the village as a provision mechanism. The soil test, partially performed in the field, provides information about chemical properties of the soil, and offers management recommendations to address limiting nutrient deficiencies, i.e., actionable information to raise agricultural yields and revenues (Corral et al., 2020, Harou et al., 2022, Tamim et al., 2022). Depending on the extent of spatial variation in soil characteristics, there may be positive externalities within the village to the provision of a single soil test, i.e, the test may be valuable not just to the owner of the plot whose soil is tested. Our sample consists of 600 farmers in 30 villages. We provided each farmer with 2000 Malawian Kwacha (MK) (about 3 $US at the time of the experiment) and conducted a total of four rounds of the public goods game in each village. In each of the first three rounds, we selected a different plot randomly chosen from the set of the plots constituted by the participant farmers. Both the cost of the soil test (7000 MK or about 10 $US) and the location of the plot selected for a soil test in each round were known by the farmers. Contributions, however, were recorded in private. In addition, we recorded the farmers’ perception of the similarity of their plot with the plot selected for testing, and other measures of soil similarity. Only one of the four rounds was randomly selected for implementation and testing, conditional on the total village contributions in that round exceeding the soil test cost. At the end of the experiment, we performed a soil analysis on the selected plot (and later on, for four more plots in the village).

We, like the farmers, distinguish between two dimensions of soil characteristics. The first dimension we call the soil type. Soil type captures observable physical characteristics of the soils including texture and color. For example, a sandy, white soil is a soil type, as is a loamy, dark soil. These characteristics are closely connected to the soil nomenclature soil scientists use, and are what we refer to in this paper when we talk about soil heterogeneity. As we will detail in the next section, our sample includes a considerable amount of soil heterogeneity, with three soil types in each village, on average. Within villages, we treat farmers who identified sharing the same soil type as members of what we call the same soil-type group. The second dimension of soil characteristics is based on the soil’s unobservable chemical properties, and represents the information provided by the soil test. </s>"

The paper explores the use of agricultural cooperatives as a savings device for farmers, as well as the potential impact of health shocks and cash constraints on farmers' decision to side-sell their produce instead of selling it to the cooperative. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, we analyze how uninsured health shocks and cash constraints influence farmers’ decision to sell to their cooperative, and whether the provision of insurance can limit side-selling. Focusing on two dairy cooperatives in Kenya, we study to what extent unexpected cash needs and fluctuating levels of cash on hand result in variation in daily milk deliveries. By paying once a month, the cooperatives defer farmers’ milk payment with an average of 25 days. As a return on this delay in payment, cooperatives may offer higher milk prices than the spot market; the monthly cooperative price in our primary study area is on average an estimated 19 to 35 percent higher than milk prices in local markets.2 We hence model the decision to sell milk to the cooperative as a savings device that yields a higher return compared with buffer stock assets such as cash, jewelry or small livestock, but at the cost of lower flexibility. Within the context of this model, health emergencies will affect the share of milk sales to the cooperative, unless farmers are protected by health insurance. More generally, in the absence of well-functioning financial markets, sales to the cooperative might decrease when cash on hand is low.

Our analysis is based on two datasets from two different Kenyan dairy farmer populations. The first is a four-wave panel dataset collected among 363 farmers, for which we also have administrative records of daily milk deliveries. Here, we find that households deliver less milk to the cooperative after having experienced health shocks. The second is a rich high-frequency diaries dataset of health events, detailed financial transactions, milk production and consumption, collected from a sample of members from another cooperative on a weekly basis over the course of a full year. The high-frequency dataset also allows us to investigate how side-selling is affected by fluctuating liquidity more generally. To proxy for cash on hand, we measure cash flows from non-dairy income in the last week and from milk production in the last month.

Using a linear specification with household and center-month fixed effects, we first investigate whether (health) shocks and their lags predict the share of milk sales to the cooperative, and whether monthly insurance coverage (which varies over time within households) reduces this effect of shocks on where the milk is sold. We conduct a variety of robustness test to examine the exogeneity of health shocks and health insurance status. We then investigate how cooperative sales are related to fluctuating levels of cash on hand, estimated from the weekly diaries data. Finally, to account for the non-linearities and threshold effects as implied by our model, we further examine the effect of cash constraints using a semiparametric approach, in which cash on hand enters nonparametrically, while including a parametric component to control for household fixed effects, other potential confounds, as well as health shocks and health insurance coverage. We also test for heterogeneity by the gender of the dairy farmer (to account for a gender bias in control over cooperative payments), the timing of milk production within the month (to differentiate between shorter and longer waiting periods until payment day) and the wet versus dry season (affecting general levels of milk production, income and liquidity). </s>"

The study uses an online survey with a treatment group receiving tips on fraud prevention and an incentivized condition to test the effect of education on scam identification ability.
The paper examines the effectiveness of educational campaigns in improving individuals' ability to detect scams and their confidence in this ability. It focuses on phone scams in Kenya and finds that while tips make individuals more cautious, they do not significantly increase scam identification ability. The study also highlights the importance of specific and targeted communication to improve scam identification. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, we study susceptibility to scams and the effectiveness of a light-touch scam education in Kenya. First, we develop a novel measure for an individual’s scam identification ability (SIA) and confidence in their ability. For this, we collect actual scams and official communication that circulate in Kenya. Second, we test experimentally if common tips for scam detection improve SIA and confidence. We focus on Kenya, Africa’s leader in digital infrastructure and mobile money use (Koyama et al., 2021). At the same time, the country suffers from increasing rates of phone scams, which by now represent the most often cited consumer protection issue (Blackmon et al., 2021).

In an online survey (N  1000) we show respondents 12 different messages and ask them to indicate whether these messages are scam or not. Each classification decision is followed by a confidence rating. The messages include both common scams and genuine messages sent by, e.g., banks or telecommunication companies in Kenya. After having classified the first six messages, a random half of the respondents receive tips on fraud prevention that are commonly provided by banks or telecommunication companies. These tips warn consumers about “scam markers”, which include (i) typos and grammar mistakes, (ii) an unknown sender, (iii) a shortened link, and (iv) requests for private information such as pin codes or passwords. Ideally, these tips help respondents become better at distinguishing scams from genuine messages. However, it is also possible that tips about scams make respondents more cautious and hence more likely to classify any given message as scam. The latter would make it harder for service providers to communicate with their clients. </s>"

The identification strategy used in this paper is based on the measure of exposure to robots in local labor markets. The authors construct this measure using data on the increase in robot usage across industries and their baseline employment shares. They exploit adoption trends in European economies to focus on the component of investment in robots driven by technological advances. The assumption is that commuting zones with greater advances in robotics technology are not differentially affected by other labor market shocks or trends.
The core story of this paper is to estimate the equilibrium impact of industrial robots on local US labor markets. The authors find a negative relationship between a commuting zone's exposure to robots and its post-1990 labor market outcomes. The increase in the stock of robots between 1993 and 2007 reduced the average employment-to-population ratio in a commuting zone by 0.39 percentage points and average wages by 0.77%. The paper also explores the differential effects of robots on workers in different industries, occupations, and skill groups. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, we estimate the equilibrium impact of a leading automation technology—industrial robots—on local US labor markets. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) defines an industrial robot as “an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, and multipurpose [machine]” (IFR 2014). That is, industrial robots are fully autonomous machines that do not need a human operator and can be programmed to perform several manual tasks, such as welding, painting, assembly, handling materials, and packaging. Textile looms, elevators, cranes, or transportation bands are not robots since they have a unique purpose, cannot be reprogrammed to perform other tasks, and/or require a human operator. This definition excludes other types of equipment and enables an internationally and temporally comparable measurement of a class of technologies—industrial robots—that are capable of replacing human labor in a range of tasks.
Our empirical approach is based on a model where robots and workers compete in the production of different tasks. Our model builds on Zeira (1998), Acemoglu and Autor (2011), and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018c) butextendstheseframeworkssothattheshareoftasksperformedbyrobots varies across sectors and there is trade between labor markets specializing in different industries. Improvements in robotics technology negatively affect wages and employment owing to a displacement effect (as robots directly displace workers from tasks that they were previously performing), but there is also a positive productivity effect (as other industries and/or tasks increase their demand for labor). Our framework clarifies that, because of the displacement effect, robots can have very different implications for labor demand than capital deepening or factor-augmenting technologies. Our model also shows that the effects of robotics technologies on employment and wages canbeestimatedbyregressingthechangeinthesevariablesonexposure to robots. Exposure to robots is a Bartik-style measure (Bartik 1991), constructed from the interaction between baseline industry shares in a local labor market and technological possibilities for the introduction of robots across industries.
After presenting industry-level correlations, we investigate the equilibrium impact of robots in local labor markets, proxied by commuting zones in the United States.2 We construct our measure of exposure to robots using data from the IFR on the increase in robot usage across 19 industries (roughly at the two-digit level outside manufacturing and at the three-digit level within manufacturing) and their baseline employment shares from the census before the onset of recent advances in robotics technology. To focus on the component of investment in robots driven by technological advances, we exploit adoption trends in European economies that are ahead of the United States in robotics. Our identifying assumption is that commuting zones housing industries with greater advances in robotics technology are not differentially affected by other labor market shocks or trends—a presumption that we investigate from a number of angles </s>"

The paper finds that the gender earnings gap among college graduates expanded by 33.7 log points from ages 26 to 39, with 80 percent of the increase occurring in the first half of the period. The gap widening is attributed to differential mobility between establishments (44 percent) and differential earnings changes within establishments (56 percent).

The identification strategy is based on exploiting a public program that rolled out broadband internet access at different times in different municipalities. The spatial and temporal variation in broadband availability is considered exogenous, and the analysis controls for fixed effects and other factors that could confound the results.
The core story of the paper is to examine how broadband internet affects labor market outcomes and productivity of different types of workers. The study finds evidence of skill complementarity of broadband internet, with wages and employment of skilled individuals increasing with broadband availability. The adoption of broadband internet in firms is also associated with a substantial increase in the output elasticity of skilled labor. </s><s>Assistant: In this article, we examine how broadband internet affects the labor market outcomes and productivity of different types of workers. Our context is the adoption of broadband internet in Norwegian firms over the period 2001–2007. Norway is a small open economy with segmented local labor markets. Our analysis employs several data sources that we can link through unique firm and individual identifiers. This gives us information over time and across areas on individuals’ wages and employment status as well as on firms’ use of input factors, adoption of broadband internet, and output. 
As a source of exogenous variation in broadband availability, we follow Bhuller et al. (2013) in exploiting a public program aimed at ensuring broadband access at a reasonable price to all households throughout the country. Because of limited funding, access to broadband was progressively rolled out, so that the necessary infrastructure (access points) was established in different municipalities at different times. Conditional on year and municipality fixed effects, we argue the spatial and temporal variation in the availability of broadband across municipalities is plausibly exogenous. Our identification strategy is motivated by two features of the broadband program. First, most of the supply and demand factors tend to vary little over time. Second, the timing of the roll-out across areas is unlikely to co-vary with the key correlates of productivity and worker outcomes. We demonstrate that the data are consistent with these program features, and further challenge our identification strategy in a number of ways, finding little cause for worry. </s>"

The paper finds that gender differences in propensity to negotiate and risk preferences account for nearly one sixth (15.5%) of the unexplained component of the gender wage gap. Including these variables in the analysis is associated with a reduction in the gender gap in earnings. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, we first describe the nature and extent of the gender wage gap in Vietnam using the nationally representative Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey (henceforth VHLSS) data.

Participants in our experiment are all manufacturing sector workers, working in the same industrial zone in North Vietnam. They are, therefore, relatively homogeneous in terms of their ability. We elicited preferences for risk using the Eckel and Grossman (2008a) risk task and preferences for negotiation using the method developed in Exley et al. (2020). The surveys collected data on a range of observable characteristics, labour market engagement and outcomes (wages, additional earnings including bonus, overtime work and hours worked). Using two empirical techniques, we estimate the gender gap in earnings and using data collected on preferences for negotiation and risk measure how these variables affect the estimated gender gap. </s>"

The paper examines the impact of mobile Internet access on political participation and electoral competition in South Africa. It finds that the arrival of mobile Internet increased political participation and competition, leading to a decrease in the popularity of the incumbent party. The study suggests that mobile Internet has the potential to improve the quality of the democratic process in developing countries. </s><s>Assistant: This paper studies whether the arrival of mobile Internet in South Africa promotes political participation and electoral competition, and affects voting behavior. Specifically, I focus on a period during which South Africa was experiencing corruption scandals and socio-economic turmoil, and look at the impact of 3G coverage on voter turnout, number of parties, and the allocation of vote shares among the major parties
Over the last 20 years, South Africa has experienced a substantial technological and political transformation. While Internet connectivity drastically improved, the incumbent party – the African National Congress – loss voters’ support, and both political participation and competition grew. However, identifying the causal impact of mobile Internet access on political outcomes is challenging. Compared to the literature on radio and TV coverage,2 in this case it is harder to exploit technological features of the transmitters to find an exogenous source of variation. Internet coverage is far from random, as it reflects private operators’ decisions on where to install the technology (Buys et al., 2009). In this paper, I rely on a granular measure of mobile Internet coverage (1 km by 1 km on the ground) from the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), and combine it with rich administrative electoral data. In particular, I assemble a new dataset containing geo-referenced information at the voting (sub)district-year-level on the share of area covered by 3G, political outcomes, protests, population density, luminosity as a proxy for GDP, and a variety of socio-demographic characteristics, infrastructure and geography.
To address endogeneity concerns and uncover causal relationships, I adopt two complementary strategies: a Difference-in-Differences estimator and an Instrumental Variable approach. In the first case, I exploit variation over time and space in the expansion of the 3G technology along with the change in political outcomes across approximately 35,000 partitions of voting districts between the 2006 and 2016 municipal elections. The second strategy exploits the variation in terrain ruggedness and its differential impact over time – pre- vs. post-2005, i.e. the year in which 3G became available – on the rollout of the 3G infrastructure. In both cases, I include a number of socio-economic and geographic control variables and their interaction with year dummies to flexibly account for potential confounders that may simultaneously explain 3G expansion and political outcomes. </s>"

The paper uses a randomized control trial to investigate the impact of digital platforms on employment outcomes for vocational training graduates in India. The authors enroll a randomly selected subset of graduates on a digital platform and compare their outcomes to a control group that is not registered on the platform. They also have a priority treatment group that receives additional information about job opportunities from the platform.
The paper finds that being enrolled on the digital platform initially leads to a decrease in employment rates for new graduates. However, as they receive more information about job opportunities from the platform, their employment rates start to catch up to the control group. The effects are stronger for graduates located in certain geographic zones and for those who are older, from lower castes, and married. The results suggest that youth may have unrealistic expectations about job market prospects and that the impact of digital platforms depends on individuals' expectations. </s><s>Assistant: Our paper proposes to investigate the benefits of digital platforms — a technology that continuously advertises new job opportunities, and has the potential to provide job seekers with a better understanding of the labor market and the jobs they can feasibly get. We partner with JobShikari.com, a digital platform that sends SMS information on low-skilled jobs to candidates registered on their platform.1 We enroll a randomly selected subset of vocational training graduates on the Job Shikari platform, and send them a brief text message indicating they will be registered with the platform. This is our first treatment group. For a second randomly-selected subset of new graduates, we provide access to the platform and grant them a priority ranking within Job Shikari’s algorithm. We refer to this second sample as the priority treatment group. Job Shikari ultimately sent 1.6 SMS messages about job opportunities per person to the treatment group, and an additional 17.4 messages to the priority treatment group for a truly intensive information intervention. We can compare these two groups to control respondents who are not registered on Job Shikari in order to estimate (1) the causal impact of platform access on employment outcomes, and (2) how these employment responses change as respondents receive more information about job opportunities from the platform. </s>"

The paper examines the unintended impacts of a digital stress management and positive parenting intervention on caregivers' mental health and parenting practices. Contrary to expectations, the intervention had an overall negative impact on caregivers' mental health but did not significantly change parenting behaviors or children's behaviors. The negative effects were concentrated among male caregivers, while female caregivers experienced a reduction in their use of physical violence. </s><s>Assistant: In particular, we stratified our randomization by caregiver’s sex to ensure balance across treatment arms in sex composition and to study the intervention’s differential impacts by this characteristic.7 Existing research has highlighted distinct roles in households, different involvement in parenting, and differences in mental health status between male and female caregivers (Giurge et al., 2021, Lundberg and Pollak, 1993, Hupkau and Petrongolo, 2020, Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017, Offer and Schneider, 2011).8 In addition, the evidence on the effects of policies aimed at improving parenting styles remains ambiguous with regard to the father’s role.9 These differences between sexes and literature gaps emphasize the need for a detailed analysis of interventions’ effects by caregivers’ sex.

To assess the intervention’s short-term effects on caregivers’ mental health and parenting practices, we collected data on caregivers’ mental health, interactions with their children, and other sociodemographic characteristics both before and after the intervention. We employed direct questions, vignette modules, and data on social desirability bias to measure and mitigate potential biases in responses, especially to sensitive questions, such as those about violence against children.

The paper uses a machine learning framework to estimate the presence of 3G coverage along road segments and combines it with accident data to explore the relationship between cell phone use and traffic accident rates.
The paper finds that the availability of 3G coverage and the widespread adoption of smartphones in 2009 are associated with a significant increase in the accident rate along road segments. The combination of 3G coverage and smartphone usage while driving appears to be responsible for the observed increase in accident rates. </s><s>Assistant: This paper explores the relationship between cell phone use by drivers and traffic accident rates by examining the increase in smartphone usage beginning in the late-2000s. To estimate smartphone use while driving, two sources of variation are leveraged: the presence of 3G coverage along a quarter-mile stretch of road and the widespread adoption of modern smartphones beginning in 2009.

The existence of 3G coverage along a quarter-mile stretch of road is estimated by combining reliable cellular coverage maps from recent years and historical cellular tower information in a machine learning framework. The dataset we create merges estimates of 3G coverage along road segments in California with accident data for each year between 2001 and 2013. A concern with using 3G coverage as the sole proxy for smartphone use is that 3G coverage pre-dates smartphone adoption in many areas. Although 3G coverage was available in the early-2000s, modern, 3G-compatible touchscreen smartphones did not become widely used until 2009. As a result, we set 2009 as the year of smartphone adoption and do not allow 3G coverage to effect accident rates until that year. </s>"

The identification strategy of the paper is to exploit the introduction of composite racquets in men's professional tennis during the late 1970s and early 1980s to study the effects of skill-altering technological change on workers.
The core story of the paper is that skill-altering technological change can disrupt the labor market by changing the relative values of skills, which can negatively impact older workers and better workers. The paper examines the effects of the introduction of composite racquets in men's professional tennis on player performance, age distribution, intergenerational inequality, and exit rates. </s><s>Assistant: We develop a theory, inspired by MacDonald and Weisbach (2004), of this phenomenon, which we call skill-altering technical change. Our theory emphasizes that workers endogenously invest in a portfolio of skills over their life cycle. We show that new technologies that change the relative values of skills can hurt older workers, who have spent a lifetime investing in the old, ideal skill mix, and better workers, who, by definition, possess more of the skills that were previously more valuable. We find that, depending on the elasticity of demand for workers’ output, the effect of a new technology can either increase or decrease exit rates and cross-sectional inequality. Moreover, the specter of future, skill-altering change makes current human capital investment risky, especially investment in specialized skills.

To test our model’s predictions empirically and quantify the effects of skill-altering technical change, we exploit the introduction of composite racquets in men’s professional tennis during the late 1970s and early 1980s. These new racquets drastically changed the way the game was played, increasing the importance of hitting with spin and power relative to control. There are four reasons this episode in men’s professional tennis is a useful setting to study the effects of skill-altering technological change on workers. First, we have detailed panel data on multiple cohorts of individual workers (players), allowing us to track the impacts of skill-altering change over multiple generations of workers. Such data is difficult to obtain in most settings. Second, the new technology arrived suddenly and unexpectedly and was adopted universally within a few years. This is valuable because the timing of the innovation is obvious, the speed of the transition reduces the concern that other economic shocks are driving the results, and this particular innovation was specific to tennis, thereby minimizing concerns about general equilibrium effects. Third, tennis careers are short—six years on average and rarely more than fifteen years—which allows us to follow multiple cohorts of players over their entire careers. Another advantage of short careers is that it further reduces the concern that other economic shocks are driving the results. Fourth, since we can observe the performance of a player without worrying about the effects of teammates, professional tennis offers unusually clean measures of worker productivity. </s>"

The paper uses a combination of a survey module and an information experiment to examine workers' beliefs about the part-time pay gap and their causal inferences.
The paper investigates whether workers form expectations about the consequences of working part-time based on misguided causal inference. It explores the presence of causal misperceptions and selection neglect in relation to the part-time pay gap. </s><s>Assistant: To examine if workers wrongly draw causal conclusions from average full-time/part-time pay gaps, we ask three research questions. First, do workers believe full-time and part-time workers earn different hourly wage rates? Second, what is the perceived causal effect of switching between full-time and part-time employment for a given worker? Third, how do perceived causal effects relate to perceived raw gaps in pay between full-time and part-time workers, and do beliefs reflect selection neglect?

To answer these questions, we implement a survey module combined with an information experiment in the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS) between 2016 and 2019. The SOEP-IS is an annual panel survey representative of German households with high quality data collection and face-to-face interviewing.

In the non-experimental part of the survey, we elicit workers’ beliefs about the mean hourly wage rate earned by full-time workers in their occupation, as well as the mean hourly wage rate earned by part-time workers in their occupation. We use these measures to quantify respondents’ beliefs about the perceived difference in hourly pay between full-time and part-time workers. Furthermore, we measure workers’ beliefs about the causal part-time wage penalty. We define the causal part-time penalty as the change in hourly pay that a given worker experiences when switching between full-time and part-time employment. Specifically, we ask respondents to consider a hypothetical scenario of switching between working 40 h per week and 20 h per week, ceteris paribus, and then provide an estimate of the expected change in hourly wage rates associated with this transition. Respondents provide three different estimates for this hypothetical scenario: i) the predicted wage change for an average full-time worker in their occupation switching to a part-time position, ii) the predicted wage change for an average part-time worker in their occupation switching to full-time, and iii) respondents’ self-expected wage change when switching between full- and part-time employment, which depends on the current employment status of the respondent (full- or part-time). The non-experimental survey data allow us to quantify the perceived raw difference in hourly pay between full-time and part-time workers, as well as the perceived causal effect of switching between full- and part-time work. To study selection neglect, we analyze descriptively whether workers distinguish between correlation and causation by examining whether they expect causal effects that are quantitatively similar to the raw wage gap they believe exists between full-time and part-time workers. To test for selection neglect more formally, we further design and implement an information experiment, described next.

The experiment allows us to causally estimate whether workers infer from average pay gaps about the causal part-time penalty. It consists of two treatment groups who receive different information, and one control group who receives no information. Participants are randomly allocated to one of the three groups with equal probability. The first treatment group receives information about the average gap in hourly pay between full-time workers and part-time workers in the German population. We elicit self-beliefs about the causal part-time penalty post treatment, using the same survey instrument as in the non-experimental questionnaire, and exploit the experimentally induced variation in beliefs between the first treatment group and the control group to analyze if individuals draw causal conclusions from correlational information.

We further use the experimental design to study the role of de-biasing and to test whether selection neglect persists when individuals are informed of the data generating process (DGP), as shown in some laboratory settings (Barron et al., 2019) but not others (López-Pérez et al., 2022). To this end, we provide the second treatment group with an alternative information treatment that also reports the average pay gap between full-time and part-time workers, but additionally educates subjects about the selection mechanism driving the observed wage gap. Specifically, the second information treatment points out that observed pay gaps between full-time and part-time workers can largely be explained by differences in work experience.

Finally, we analyze some behavioral implications of worker beliefs about part-time pay. Exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the SOEP-IS, we study descriptively how worker beliefs relate to planned and realized transitions between full-time and part-time employment. </s>"

The paper examines the connection between earnings inequality and working hours mismatch in Germany. It finds that rising working hours inequalities and the increasing covariance between working hours and wages play a predominant role in increasing earnings inequality. The inability to realize optimal working hours, particularly among female service sector employees, contributes significantly to rising earnings inequality. </s><s>Assistant: Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the period 1993 to 2018, we study earnings inequality and its drivers—working hours, hourly wages, and the statistical association between the two—and compare these findings to a hypothetical counterfactual earnings distribution. This counterfactual earnings distribution is based on employees’ hourly wages and desired optimal working hours. We are not aware of any empirical studies that provide such a systematic exploration. This is understandable because in a world in which the assumptions of the neoclassical model do not hold, estimating the labor supply function is challenging. The estimation of the labor supply function based on the axiom of revealed preferences relies on data on actual working hours and wages and involves identification assumptions regarding, among other things, the number of job offers and the working hours stipulated in them (Bloemen, 2008, Pencavel, 2016). Other identification issues concern the functional form of the labor supply function and the set of covariates considered. These identification issues motivate the interest in stated preferences in the form of self-reported desired working hours as an alternative data source.3 Precisely such self-reported desired hours—together with actual hourly wages—are used to construct the counterfactual distribution in the present paper.4 </s>"

This paper develops a measure of WTP for air quality improvements that accounts for both the direct health impacts and defensive investments. As a measure of defensive behavior, we investigate whether medication usage responds to changes in air quality. This is likely to be an especially important measure of defensive expenditures, because, for example, the annual cost of prescription medications for asthma is reported to exceed the monetized value of any other component of asthma’s social cost, including mortality, emergency department admissions, or lost productivity (Weiss and Sullivan 2001). We also provide new evidence on how air pollution affects more commonly studied outcomes like mortality and hospitalizations.

The empirical application is based on a quasi-experiment that exploits three sources of variation in the introduction of an emissions market for nitrogen oxides (NOx). The NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) operated a cap-and-trade system for over 2,500 electricity generating units and industrial boilers in the eastern and midwestern United States between 2003 and 2008. Because this market had the goal of decreasing ozone pollution, which reaches high levels in summer, the market operated only between May 1 and September 30. Specifically, we use a triple-difference estimator that compares pollution, defensive expenditures, and health outcomes in the NBP participating and nonparticipating states, before versus after 2003, and summer versus winter. </s>"

The paper uses the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model in a global context to explore idiosyncratic volatility as a measure of country-specific risk and analyze its determinants in both developed and emerging markets.
The paper finds that idiosyncratic volatility at the country level does not follow a stable trend and is higher in emerging markets compared to developed markets. The study identifies market turnover, information disclosure, investor uncertainty avoidance, and various economic, financial, and political risk factors as determinants of country-level idiosyncratic volatility. Financial risk factors, such as foreign exchange stability and foreign debt health, have the highest explanatory power. </s><s>Assistant: In our empirical analyses, in order to fully diversify the firm-level idiosyncratic risk measure in one economy, and generate the pure country-level idiosyncratic risk measure, we use the total stock market index returns in each country as the dependent variable in Fama and French (1993) three-factor model, rather than using the individual stock returns, obtaining the firm-specific risk from those residuals, and then aggregating them. Specifically, we develop global versions of the ?m–?f , SMB, and HML variables as the three risk factors of the Fama–French model to generate the country-specific residuals from the global version of the Fama–French three-factor model so that we can calculate the country-level idiosyncratic risk as the standard deviation of these residuals from this global three-factor model. Moreover, we estimate both unconditional and conditional idiosyncratic volatility measures for each country for each year. In obtaining the residuals to calculate both the country-level unconditional and the country-level conditional idiosyncratic volatility measures, in addition to OLS, we also use the quantile regression (Koenker and Basset, 1978) and the quantile GARCH regression (Xiao and Koenker, 2009) estimation techniques for the global version of the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993). The quantile regression technique is particularly useful to explore the idiosyncratic volatility based on different distribution of stock </s>"

The identification strategy used in the paper is based on the analysis of firm-level data collected in Libya during the Second Libyan Civil War. The researchers combine this data with geolocalized information on conflict events to assess the impact of conflict on firms' economic performance.
The paper examines the effect of conflict on firms' economic performance in Libya. It explores the mechanisms through which conflict affects firms' activities, including the reduction in productivity of production inputs and the increase in firms' exit. The study finds that the negative effect of conflict on firms' output is non-linear, with the marginal effect becoming smaller for surviving firms as conflict intensity increases. </s><s>Assistant: Our analysis is guided by a simple theoretical framework to study the impact of conflict exposure on firms’ activities. Firms produce by combining domestic and foreign inputs, and high-productivity firms are more intensive in foreign inputs. Conflict exposure for the firm enters the production function as a reduction in the productivity (availability) of these inputs. However, depending on the nature of the conflict, the latter affects inputs’ productivity differently. We show that an increase in conflict intensity decreases output, induces factors’ substitution, and increases firms’ exit. These effects are heterogeneous across firms depending on the intensity of the impact of conflict on different inputs and the input mix adopted by the firm. Two are the novel implications of our theoretical framework. First, the relationship between a firm’s productivity and resilience to conflict depends on the type of conflict. In particular, there is a negative (positive) relationship – i.e., low productivity firms suffer a smaller (larger) output drop – if conflict events affect relatively more (less) foreign inputs. Second, the negative effect of conflict on a firm’s output is non-linear. As conflict intensity increases, its marginal effect becomes smaller for surviving firms. </s>"

The paper finds that firms with higher innovative efficiency tend to have higher future stock returns and operating performance.

The paper uses a high-dimensional fixed effect technique and instrumental variable (IV) method to estimate the causal effects of air pollution on social conflicts. The fixed effect model controls for confounding factors and uses variations in pollution exposure across dates for individuals in the same city. The IV method uses temperature inversion and wind patterns as exogenous shocks to pollution concentrations.
The paper examines the causal link between air pollution and social conflicts in China. It finds that air pollution increases the likelihood and numbers of social conflicts, with larger effects when endogeneity is accounted for. The impacts of pollution on conflicts are nonlinear and more pronounced in severe pollution levels. The study also highlights differences in effects for indoor vs. outdoor workers and developed vs. developing regions. </s><s>Assistant: Using identification strategies, we perform the following steps to address potential confounders that may covary with structural, seasonal, and weather-related phenomena as well as measurement error associated with artificial disconnection between the pollution readings from official data and the actual pollution exposure faced by individuals. First, we rely on the panel structure of the data and utilize a high-dimensional fixed effect technique to estimate the causal relations, controlling for a series of meteorological factors in flexible forms and a rich set of fixed effects to capture time-invariance and time-varying confounding factors. Conditional on such confounding factors, the variations used for identification in the fixed effect model come from different levels of exposure to air pollution across dates for individuals living in the same city. 

Second, leveraging the rich information from the daily dataset, we also construct effective instruments to address potential con founders that may covary with structural and seasonal-related phenomena. Specifically, we use the instrumental variable (IV) method, in which temperature inversion and wind patterns (i.e., wind direction and wind speed) are adopted as exogenous shocks to local air pollution concentrations. The latter one is used in the robustness checks. These instrumental variables are quite plausible and have precedent in the literature, for example, bolstering causal claims by instrumenting for pollution with plausibly exogenous variations in temperature inversion (Dechezlepr?etre et al., 2019; Klauber et al., 2020; Yi et al., 2020) and wind patterns (Bondy et al., 2020; Deryugina et al., 2019; Heyes and Zhu, 2019).

One potential concern in linking pollution exposure to social conflicts is the fact that the effect of air pollution on biological processes such as hormones can accumulate over time. The identification challenge here lies in the fact that the dates of social conflicts may not always coincide with the dates of corresponding air pollution in that city. We thus replicate our analysis from the daily level to a more aggregated time scale, i.e., the monthly level. </s>"

The study uses a proxy for digital transformation based on a Chinese dictionary of digital keywords and validates its effectiveness through stock price co-movement. The causal relationship between digital transformation and stock price crash risk is explored using instrumental variable, Heckman two-step, and propensity score methods.
The study examines the relationship between digital transformation and stock price crash risk in Chinese listed firms. It finds that digital transformation significantly reduces stock price crash risk. The study also explores the moderating effects of firm size, analyst attention, industry attributes, and informal institution on this relationship. Additionally, it investigates the potential mechanisms of information and internal control channels. </s><s>Assistant: Our empirical strategy includes four stages. In the first stage, a proxy for the digital transformation of firms is constructed and validated for effectiveness. We build a Chinese dictionary containing digital keywords related to digital transformation by using the textual analysis method. In particular, basic phrases related to digital transformation are selected by sorting policy documents and extended thereafter using the textual analysis method. A total of 37,266 annual reports are obtained and a deep learning model RoBERTa-wwm-ext (Cui et al., 2019) is used to identify those that are similar to the basic phrases in the annual reports. The proportion of intangible assets related to digital keywords is used as proxy for digital transformation. We follow the literature (Chen & Srinivasan, 2019) and validate the effectiveness of the proxy for digital transformation by investigating the stock price co-movement. In the second stage, the causal relationship between digital transformation and stock price crash risk is explored. We find that digital transformation significantly reduces the stock price crash risk. To address endogeneity problems, we use the instrumental variable method, Heckman two-step method, and propensity score method (PSM). Other robustness checks are likewise carried out, and the results support the benchmark conclusion. In the third stage, heterogeneity analysis is conducted to determine the moderating effects of firm size, analyst attention, industry attributes, and informal institution on the aforementioned relationship. Findings show that the attenuation effect of digital transformation on stock price crash risk is stronger for firms with small sizes, with low analyst attention, in technology industries, and in areas with high trust. In the fourth stage, potential associated mechanisms are explored. The two main reasons for stock price crash risk are agency problem and information asymmetry (Chen, Hong, & Stein, 2001; Jin & Myers, 2006). The current study validates two potential mechanisms: information and internal control channels. We find that digital trans formation significantly reduces opacity cost and increases internal control quality. </s>"

The results largely support our conjectures and are consistent under alternative variable measurements.

The paper adopts several methods to control for omitted variable bias and identify the causal effect of language FTR on innovation. It controls for various country characteristics and conducts within-country tests to alleviate concerns of omitted variable bias. It also investigates the impact of CEO birthplace and inventor nationality to further control for country fixed effects.
The paper examines the impact of language future-time reference (FTR) on innovation. It argues that languages with strong-FTR, which grammatically separate the future and the present, lead to a decreased perceived present value of future rewards, resulting in fewer innovative activities. Using a large sample of firms from 34 countries, the paper finds that firms in countries with strong-FTR languages register fewer patents and receive fewer citations compared to firms in countries with weak-FTR languages. </s><s>Assistant: Because language structure is clearly out of a firm’s control, it is unlikely that the causation goes from innovation to language FTR. However, our findings are subject to omitted variable bias due to the correlation between language and country-level characteristics. We adopt several methods to control for omitted variable bias to identify the causal effect. First, we control for a variety of country characteristics ranging from formal institutions such as legal origin, religion and intellectual property protection to informal institutions such as various cultural attributes. Second, although we control for a battery of country-level characteristics, our results might still be biased due to other observable and unobservable country-level attributes. To further alleviate these concerns, we conduct within-country tests by studying a single country with a multilingual environment. The within-country tests avoid omitted country-level bias because all firms face the same country-level characteristics

To investigate the underlying economic mechanism of our findings, we collect information on CEO birthplace and inventor nationality in our sample. We distinguish whether the CEO (inventor) is from a strong-FTR-speaking country and rerun our regression. We find that firms with CEOs (inventors) from countries where strong-FTR languages are spoken are associated with lower innovation output, indicating that language FTR shapes perceptions and beliefs around future rewards from innovation. Another advantage of investigating inventor language is that we are able to directly control for country fixed effects to alleviate the concern of omitted variable bias.

Finally, we perform a variety of additional tests to ensure the robustness of the main results. First, we adopt four alternative measures to define language FTR. Specifically, we assign language into weak and strong-FTR groups using two stronger criteria (Inflectional FTR and Prediction FTR). In addition, we apply two continuous measures (Verb Ratio and Sentence Ratio) based on a word-frequency analysis of online weather forecasts. Second, we choose to use 2-year ahead and 3-year-ahead innovation outputs as alternative dependent variables because innovation represents a long term investment in intangible assets. We also adopt the log value of one plus citations per patent to proxy for the quality of innovation. Finally, our findings might be driven by specific countries. To rule out this possibility, we exclude US firms and countries with multiple official languages, and the main results still hold. </s>"

The paper uses fixed-effects panel regression models to estimate the effect of higher-order moments of the distribution of daily rainfall on economic production. This approach allows for the assessment of causal effects between changes in rainfall and economic outcomes.
The paper aims to address the limitations of previous macro-economic assessments by examining the impact of rainfall changes on economic production at a higher spatial resolution and a wider range of timescales. It argues that focusing on annual totals and monthly means may not capture the realistic future costs, and highlights the importance of considering higher-order moments of the distribution of daily rainfall. </s><s>Assistant: To address these issues, we assess higher-order moments of the annual distribution of daily rainfall in conjunction with subnational eco[1]nomic output. The distribution of daily rainfall is highly non-Gaussian (Fig.?1) and we therefore take a threshold approach. We count both the number of days and the amount of rainfall on days falling above a wide range of critical thresholds to flexibly identify different possible impact channels. Thresholds are set either as constants or as percentiles of the historical distribution (1979–2019) of local daily rainfall (Methods). The second approach allows us to implicitly account for local adaptation to prevailing rainfall conditions. Furthermore, we calculate the total annual rainfall and standardized monthly rainfall anomalies to assess the results of previous studies and their relation to the daily measures introduced here (see Extended Data Fig.?1 for maps of the principal rainfall measures considered). Standardized monthly rainfall anomalies constitute an annual sum of monthly rainfall anomalies from their climatological means, weighted by their historical contribution to the annual rainfall, as defined in ref. 5 and shown in equation?(4) in Methods. Our primary source of climate data is the surface precipitation rate from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA-5) of historical observations, owing to its global coverage, high spatial and temporal resolution, and high-degree of correlation with ground-based measurements of rainfall at the daily timescale22. </s>"

The paper aims to examine the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on idiosyncratic risk (IR) and how this relationship can be influenced by firms' operational characteristics. The researchers find that CSR has a U-shaped relationship with IR, indicating that there is an optimal level of CSR that can reduce IR. They also find that operational efficiency moderates the negative effect of CSR on IR, while artificial intelligence innovation inhibits the positive effect of CSR. </s><s>Assistant: To examine these ideas, we collect data on Chinese firms listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) from 2010 to 2017. All these firms are rated with CSR scores by Hexun.com according to their financial statements and CSR reports.2 We collect the financial data from the RESSET and CSMAR databases to obtain as com[1]prehensive a dataset as possible.3 Following Mishra and Modi (2013), we use monthly financial data and a four-factor asset pricing model (FF4, Carhart 1997) to calculate IR at the firm-year level. We follow Yiu et al. (2020) to calculate OE using the stochastic frontier approach first proposed by Aigner et al. (1977). We measure AII as the logarithm of 1 plus the number of AI-related invention patents and utility model patents (Li et al. 2019, Schilling 2015). The patents are collected from a patent analysis platform called Paten[1]tics.4 The patent classification is based on the US patent classification (UPC), the international patent classification (IPC) (Tseng and Ting 2013), Patentics’ semantic retrieval, and AI-related keywords. Given the collected data, we first estimate IR by running panel regressions with independent variable CSR, time, and individual fixed effects and with control variables that may affect IR. We then explore the moderating roles of OE and AII to further explore the impact of CSR on IR. We lag the independent variable CSR and control variables to capture some of the reverse causality effects (Luo and Bhattacharya 2009, Mishra and Modi 2013).

The paper utilizes a difference-in-differences empirical strategy to investigate the impact of the incorporating-counties-into-prefectures reform on local economic growth in China. It constructs control groups to address endogeneity and spillover effects.
The paper examines the effect of eliminating policy-induced frictions between jurisdictions on local economic growth in China. It finds that the reform significantly increased economic growth in the incorporated counties, both immediately and persistently. The positive effects were not solely driven by a transfer of economic activities but by genuine increases in aggregate economic development. </s><s>Assistant: To investigate the impact of the incorporating-counties-into-prefectures reform on local economic growth, we utilize county-level panel data from 1995 to 2013 and employ a difference-in-differences empirical strategy. We use GDP and nighttime light intensity to measure aggregate outcomes. Nighttime light intensity, gathered from weather satellite recordings, has been increasingly used by economists to measure economic activity in developing countries, especially at the local level (Henderson et al., 2012, Hodler and Raschky, 2014, Storeygard, 2016). Because nighttime light intensity is not susceptible to political manipulations, it complements GDP as a measure of economic activity.

Two challenges need to be addressed to empirically test the effect of eliminating market frictions, as pointed out by Donaldson (2015). The first challenge is finding a suitable control group to address the endogeneity issue. Misallocations may not be the only difference between the treatment and the control group. The second challenge, as proposed by Rubin (1980), is that the control and treatment groups should not interact; otherwise, there may be over-estimation or under-estimation, depending on the direction of the spillover effect.

Firstly, we construct a list of counties chosen by prefecture-level cities to be incorporated but not approved by higher-level governments due to various political and geographical reasons. This allows us to compare the treatment group to an applied-but-failed group, which helps adjust for the nonrandom selection of counties by prefectures.

Secondly, we take advantage of the exogenous timing of the incorporation for those successfully incorporated counties. Specifically, we compare counties that experienced incorporation in year  to those that would experience incorporation at least  years later, for example, in year  and onwards. The two control groups partially solve the second identification problem, as the treatment and control counties are relatively isolated geographically. </s>"

The identification strategy used in the paper is based on the variation in exposure to new genetically engineered (GE) soy seeds and increased demand from China across Brazilian municipalities. The authors assume that this variation is uncorrelated with other factors influencing land use changes.
The paper examines the local deforestation impacts of trade and agricultural productivity in Brazil. It finds that while increased agricultural productivity from GE soy seeds led to increased deforestation, the rise in export demand from China mitigated the deforestation effects of the GE soy seeds. The study highlights the importance of considering both factors together when analyzing their impact on deforestation. </s><s>Assistant: This paper quantifies the relative local impact of agricultural productivity gains and the rise in international demand on the expansion of agricultural land over forested areas. Specifically, we disentangle the effects of two quasi-exogenous indicators of local exposure to new genetically engineered (GE) soy seeds and increased demand from China on deforestation and land use across Brazilian municipalities from 2000 to 2017. We measure local exposure to technological innovation by assessing the potential productivity gains resulting from adopting new GE soy seeds introduced in Brazil in 2003 (Bustos et al., 2016). We measure local exposure to increased export demand from China involves a two-step process (Costa et al., 2016). We first use international trade flow data to compute the differential growth in Chinese demand for each product compared to the rest of the world (excluding Brazil). Then, we allocate the China-product-specific demand growth to municipalities in Brazil based on their production composition in 1995.

Key to our identification, we show that there is variation in differential exposure to Chinese demand and productivity shocks across municipalities. This enables us to study their effects in a single equation, as in Autor et al. (2015). Our identifying assumption is that variation in suitability for GE soy seeds and exposure to China-induced export demand are uncorrelated with other factors influencing land use changes. Moreover, our method for measuring local exposure to increased Chinese demand relies on the assumption of shock exogeneity. Following Borusyak et al. (2022)’s framework, we establish that quasi-random shock assignment is a reasonable assumption in our context, and we have a sufficient number of uncorrelated shocks. Reassuringly, we find no correlations between both exposure measures and land-use patterns during the pre-treatment period from 1995 to 2000. </s>"

The identification strategy used in the paper is a quasi-random allocation of licenses to accept digital cash transfers. The authors provide evidence suggesting that the allocation of licenses was quasi-random, conditional on the data considered by the selection committee. They use matching methods to estimate the medium-term effects of obtaining a license on business and household outcomes.
The core story of the paper is to examine the indirect effects of a large-scale program of restricted cash transfers on local businesses in Kenya. The authors find that businesses that received a license to accept digital cash transfers experienced significant increases in revenue, profits, and productivity. They also find that the program created a two-tier market structure, with lower prices in the cash market and higher prices in the restricted market for digital cash transfers or vouchers. </s><s>Assistant: First, we build a theoretical model of the effects of a cash-based intervention on prices, business outcomes, and household welfare. The predicted impacts of transfers on households and businesses depend on the degree of competition but also on the characteristics of the cash-based intervention. The case of unrestricted cash transfers in a perfectly competitive market is simple: apart from a possible period of adjustment in the short run, businesses do not benefit from transfers as prices are equal to marginal costs. Benefits are entirely reaped by transfer recipients. Markets are however rarely perfect, especially in developing countries. Regulations and credit constraints often act as entry barriers in the formal sector. Prices are rarely indicated. Transportation costs can be very large, as roads are often non-existent or in poor conditions. The presence of fixed costs means that the assumption of non-increasing returns to scale is often inaccurate. We build a Salop circle model to study the effects of cash transfers in the presence of market imperfections. With entry barriers and transportation costs, we find that businesses indirectly benefit from cash transfers, even after the adjustment period in the short run.

We also extend the model to study the case of restricted cash transfers that can only be spent at a limited number of licensed shops. Restricted cash transfer programs are widespread, taking the form of digital cash transfers or vouchers (Siu et al., 2023). Girling and Urquhart (2021) estimate that, 29 percent of cash-based humanitarian assistance in 2020 – nearly 2 billion USD – was provided with restrictions on how and where the transfers can be spent. In the US, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is distributing electronic cash transfers restricted to food, reaching 40 million Americans in 2018 with total benefits amounting to 61 billion USD. Restricted cash transfers are also used to promote eco-friendly consumption, as seen in programs like the EcoCheque program in Belgium.4 With restricted transfers, we show that a two-tier market structure with two different sets of prices may emerge: low prices in the cash market, which is more competitive, and high prices in the new, restricted, market for digital cash transfers or vouchers.

Our empirical analysis assesses the business impacts of a large-scale program of restricted cash transfers implemented by the World Food Programme (WFP) in Kenya. In 2018, about 400,000 refugees living in camps or settlements in Kenya were receiving monthly digital transfers worth 3 to 13 dollars.5 These transfers were restricted to food items and can only be spent at licensed shops. To ensure only licensed vendors could sell to beneficiaries, WFP used a mobile money platform only accessible to that group of vendors. Licenses were allocated by WFP following a competitive process in two steps. First, applicants had to fill an application form, in which they had to describe the characteristics of their businesses and commit to certain standards of conduct. Second, a multi-stakeholder committee with representatives from humanitarian organizations and the Government of Kenya allocated the licenses based on the data in the application forms. They deliberately selected a diversity of shop owners in terms of gender, origin, and location of their shops.We assess the impact of being allocated a license on the business and household outcomes of applicants. First, we provide evidence suggesting that the allocation of licenses was quasi-random, conditional on the data considered by the selection committee. In particular, the unconfoundedness assumption is plausible in our study, because: (1) we have a detailed understanding of how the licensing process took place; (2) we have access to all the data available to the selection committee; (3) licensed and unlicensed businesses are operating in the same economic environment and have been administered the same surveys; (4) placebo tests confirm that treatment status is uncorrelated with pre-determined characteristics proxying for entrepreneurial ability; and (5) proxies for business size and capacity are insignificant when estimating the propensity score, showing that the selection committee did not systematically select the most (or least) successful businesses. As the unconfoundedness assumption is rhetorically and statistically plausible (McKenzie, 2021), experimental and matching methods should yield similar unbiased impact estimates (Heckman et al., 1997, Dehejia and Wahba, 2002, Diaz and Handa, 2006). We match successful and unsuccessful applicants using data from the application process, and estimate the medium-term effects of obtaining a license to accept the digital cash from the transfer on the revenue, profit, and productivity of businesses and on some aspects of their operations, including prices. In addition, we estimate medium-term effects on household consumption, asset ownership, and total household income of applicants. </s>"

The paper uses a combination of cross-sectional and time-series variation in violence to identify the causal effect of conflict on social capital. The cross-sectional variation is based on the suitability for growing coca in Colombian municipalities, while the time-series variation comes from external shocks to coca markets in Peru and Bolivia.
The paper examines the impact of violence on social capital in Colombia, a country with high levels of violence. It argues that the effect of violence on social capital depends on the ability to identify the enemy and the intensity of the violence. The results show that violence has a negative effect on social capital, but the effect is weaker when the perpetrators can be identified and for lower levels of violence. </s><s>Assistant: Specifically, I propose that the impact of violence on social capital depends on two factors: (i) the possibility of identifying the enemy, and (ii) the intensity of the violence. With regard to the former, the ability to distinguishing the enemy affects the certainty of whom people can trust. In municipalities in which violent attacks were perpetrated by difficult to discern militias, the effect is larger than when armed groups were clearly identifiable. Indeed, militias do not wear uniforms, bracelets with groups insignias, flags, or carry visible guns, and tend to mostly dress like the civilian population. As concerns the latter factor, very high levels of violence can be so disruptive that communities are unable to react, unlike for low levels of violence where the possibility of organizing to fight a common threat is greater. A failure to account for these two factors provides a tenable explanation for the mixed results found by different scholars.

Two main challenges arise in estimating the causal effect of conflict on social capital. On the one hand, social capital levels could affect the intensity of conflict, leading to reverse causality concerns. This is the case if well-organized communities protect themselves from violent attacks through neighborhood watch schemes (Kaplan et al., 2010), or if armed groups target communities with low social capital so as to more easily take control. On the other hand, the correlation between conflict and social capital may be driven by omitted variables (i.e. the large variation in institutional performance), which could have a confounding effect rather than reflecting a causal impact. In either case, the measures of conflict on social capital will likely be biased.

I overcome these issues by exploiting the combination of a cross-sectional variation in violence and a plausible exogenous time-series variation in violence. The first source of variation regards the suitability for growing coca in Colombian municipalities, an important dimension given that armed groups largely finance their fighting with coca production. The second refers to external shocks to coca markets in Peru and Bolivia. Together with Colombia, these two countries are the main coca leaf producers in the world (UNODC, 2009). Thus, the eradication of coca plants in neighboring countries affects the demand for coca in Colombia, and in turn the intensity of violence. Mejia and Restrepo (2015) argue that the presence of coca plantations leads to violence, as property rights must be protected from other armed groups, and because violence is required to control municipalities for the planting of coca.5 Since these shocks should affect coca-producing municipalities differently than non-producers, I use satellite data on ecological conditions to construct an exogenous index for coca cultivation at the municipal level. Using the interaction between cross-border shocks on coca markets and the coca index as an instrument has two main advantages: (i) it provides conditionally random variation in violence over time, and (ii) it allows for different trends of violence across municipalities.

The validity of the instrument hinges on one critical assumption: cross-border shocks to the coca market did not affect municipalities that were more suitable for coca production in other unobservable dimensions. I address this concern by showing that the results are robust to the inclusion of controls for employment, pupils registered at school, tax collection, forced displaced population, suitability for growing coffee, and the possible legacy of the biggest drug lord in Colombia, Pablo Escobar. In addition, I present several checks that suggest that coca production has an effect on social capital only through the channel of violence. To this end, I digitized historical records on community organizations, an assessment of which indicates that the suitability for growing coca only affects social capital when the conflict is financed by coca, and not for previous political conflicts. </s>"

The identification strategy used in the paper is based on exploiting exogenous variation in the local presence of peacekeepers. The road distance of DHS cluster's centroid to the closest UN base is used as a measure of individual exposure to peacebuilding activities.
The paper examines the effects of peacebuilding on fertility rates in Liberia, a country with a history of violent conflict and high fertility rates. The findings suggest that peacebuilding has a significant negative effect on fertility, with a decline in the likelihood of having a child and a decrease in the total number of children per woman. The study explores the mechanisms behind these findings, including increased contraceptive use, improved access to healthcare, and a shift towards a 'quality over quantity' approach to parenting. </s><s>Assistant: Against this backdrop of conflicting evidence, we explore the case of Liberia. With a history of violent conflict, and one of the world's highest fertility rates, averaging 4 children per woman compared to the global average of 2.5 (UN DESA, 2019), Liberia provides a crucial case for investigating the effects of peacebuilding on fertility rates. Between 2003 and 2018, the country hosted the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), one of the largest and most important peacekeeping missions since 1960. The main task of UNMIL was to support the implementation of a peace process in the immediate aftermath of the Second Liberian Civil War, with the arrival of peacekeepers marking the end of the conflict. However, simply reaching peace agreements and ending the conflict does not necessarily guarantee the cessation of violence or improve perceptions of security. Even if violence subsides, its psychological impact can linger on, and perceptions of insecurity may affect fertility. Focusing on the effect of peacekeeping operations in a post-conflict setting helps us examine the joint role of security and service provision in shaping fertility decisions.5 Indeed, while violence halted across the country, only some locations benefitted from the enhanced peace (security and services) provided by the UN intervention.

We integrate geocoded data on the local deployment of UNMIL with the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Liberia in 2007, 2013, and 2019. To identify the casual effect of peacebuilding on fertility, we exploit exogenous variation in the local presence of peacekeepers. We use the road distance of DHS cluster's centroid to the closest UN base, providing a granular measure of individual exposure to peacebuilding activities. Since the location of the women corresponds to the centroid of the cluster, more than one woman is usually assigned to the same centroid. </s>"

The identification strategy of the paper is to use wealth management products (WMPs) in China, which have a local market, to examine the effect of housing market performance on the expected returns offered by banks for their WMPs. The cross-location and over-time variations in both housing market performance and the expected returns on WMPs are used to identify the effect on the financing costs of financial institutions.
The core story of the paper is that housing booms can elevate the financing costs of financial institutions. Higher house price appreciation rates lead to increased investment in the housing market by households, reducing their investments in non-real estate assets and requiring higher returns on other investment opportunities. This increased demand for housing investments raises the financing costs for financial institutions. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the effect of house price growth on the financing costs of financial institutions. If real estate assets exhibit higher appreciation rates, households will expect greater future house price appreciation and thus invest more of their savings into the housing market and invest less in or require a higher return on other investment opportunities (e.g., deposits, bonds, and stocks), which will increase the financing costs of financial institutions and firms.1

One challenge to identify the effect of housing market performance on financing costs in the economy is that although housing markets are local, the markets of other investment tools are usually national: returns of bonds and stocks are determined by all investors throughout the country; deposit rates in China are strictly regulated by the central bank. Consequently, although there could be a spurious correlation between the national trend in housing markets and the returns of deposits, bonds, and stocks, it is far from sufficient to make a causal inference. It is possible that a third macroeconomic factor (e.g., monetary policy) affects both the national trend in housing markets and the returns of deposits, bonds, and stocks and therefore generates this spurious correlation.

In this paper, we employ wealth management products (WMPs), the largest component of China's shadow-banking sector, and examine how housing market performance affects the expected returns (promised yields at issuance) offered by banks for their WMPs. Unlike bonds and stocks, many WMPs have a local market, i.e., they are sold exclusively to a certain city or several cities. To be able to purchase WMPs issued in a certain city, households have to visit a local branch of a bank to open a local account. Accordingly, our identification strategy is that we employ the cross-location and over-time variations in both housing market performance and the expected returns offered by banks on their WMPs to identify the effect of housing market performance on the financing costs of financial institutions.
To summarize, there are two requirements in our identification strategy: first, the issuing market of the WMPs should be local; second, the market of the investment target for the money raised from the WMPs should be national. There are many financial products in which households invest their savings and through which financial institutions and nonfinancial firms raise funds, but only WMPs in China can simultaneously meet these two requirements for identification. The issuing markets of stocks and bonds are national. The deposit market and deposit rates in China are strictly regulated by the central bank. Although the deposit markets in the U.S. could be local because local banks can determine their interest rates of deposits with a certain degree of freedom,3 the deposits obtained locally are more likely to be invested in local businesses.

To examine the microeconomic mechanism through which housing market performance affects the financing costs of financial institutions, we further conduct household-level analyses by using data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) and provide evidence that house price growth can crowd out households' WMP investments.  </s>"

The paper uses an annual panel of over 4000 rural households in northeast China from 2004-2014 and matches it with high-frequency weather data to identify the economic impacts of extreme heat on corn-growing households and their adaptive behaviors.
The paper examines how rural households in northeast China respond to extreme heat shocks and mitigate economic losses. It finds that extreme heat significantly reduces corn yields and leads to substantial economic losses, but impacted households successfully smooth their consumption through the use of financial assets and buffer stocks. The paper also highlights the lack of contemporaneous production adjustments and the forward-looking behavior of households in adjusting their crop mix towards heat-resistant crops. </s><s>Assistant: This paper conducts a detailed empirical investigation on how rural households respond to extreme heat shocks and how well they attenuate economic losses using various adaptive strategies. A key innovation of our work is to provide a comprehensive assessment on rural households’ adaptive behaviors by simultaneously examining their consumption and productive adjustments to the experience of extreme heat. The interconnection between production and consumption is particularly relevant in the developing country contexts given that a long literature has suggested the non-separability between production and consumption adjustments when market imperfections exist (De Janvry et al., 1991, Taylor and Adelman, 2003, LaFave and Thomas, 2016).
We match station-monitored high-frequency weather data with an annual panel of more than 4000 rural households over 2004–2014 in northeast China. Our panel data of rural households are based on a unique annual survey that records rich information on household-level characteristics, expenditures, food consumption, crop-specific productive behaviors, financial behaviors, and assets. Exploiting exogenous year-to-year variation in growing-season temperature, we identify the economic impacts of extreme heat on corn-growing households, their responses in consumption, and their adaptive behaviors in asset management and productive adjustments.

The paper uses several estimation strategies including instrumental variable (IV), difference-in-difference (DID), synthetic control, and panel fixed effects to overcome the challenge of endogeneity in estimating the economic impact of electricity outages.
The paper examines the impact of electricity outages on employment in Africa. It finds that outages have a negative effect on employment, with estimates suggesting a 4.7 to 13.5 percentage point increase in unemployment. The effects are concentrated in non-agricultural sectors and skilled jobs, with private-sector workers being most affected. </s><s>Assistant: However, causal estimation of the economic impact of outages is beset with the challenge of endogeneity, as the incidence and intensity of electricity outages are non-random across space and time.5 To overcome this challenge of identification, the paper uses several estimation strategies namely: instrumental variable (IV), difference-in-difference (DID), synthetic control, and panel fixed effects.

The empirical strategy of the paper is summarized as follows: In the main analysis, I use an IV strategy that exploits plausibly exogenous variations in the incidence of outages induced by variations in lightning strikes across space and time. Lightning strikes are known to be a major cause of surges in electrical systems leading to over-voltage and destruction of power infrastructure thereby causing outages (Andersen et al., 2011, Andersen et al., 2012, Andersen and Dalgaard, 2013). Leveraging this relationship between lightning activities and electricity outages, I combine granular data on measures of lightning intensity with data from the Afrobarometer dataset in 25 countries to estimate the causal effect of outages on employment. Beyond the cross-country analysis, I present two country case studies from Ghana and Nigeria. In the case of Ghana, I exploit a nationwide power crisis (“dumsor”) between 2013 and 20166 as a natural experiment to examine the impact of the power crisis on employment using a DID design, while in the case of Nigeria, I leverage detailed household panel data to examine the association between exposure to outages and employment outcomes using a fixed effect estimator. Finally, in terms of causal mechanisms, I provide evidence on the intensive and extensive margins. On the intensive margin, I use firm-level data from 10 African countries to evaluate the effect of outages on firm performance and labor demand using the same IV design. On the extensive margin, I evaluate the effect of electricity outages on (net) firm entry using data from Ethiopia and Ghana via fixed effect and synthetic control methods. </s>"

The study uses within-prefecture variations in cohort sizes, controlling for prefecture-pair fixed effects and flexible trends in province pairs, to identify the causal effects of cohort sizes on migration flows between origin and destination prefectures in China.
The paper examines how fertility differentials shape internal migration in China and explores the demographic impacts of migration on labor market outcomes and marriage prospects. It also investigates the moderating effects of physical distance and social network on migration costs. The study finds that fertility differentials, physical distance, and social network play significant roles in shaping internal migration in China. </s><s>Assistant: We examine how the internal migration in China in 1996–2010 responds to fertility differentials by exploiting large variations in birth cohort sizes in 331 prefectures. Unlike one-way immigration flows from developing Latin American countries to the developed U.S. Hanson and McIntosh, 2009, Hanson and McIntosh, 2010, Hanson and McIntosh, 2012, we examine bilateral migration flows among poor and rich regions within a single country. Following the renewed interest in using gravity models to identify determinants of cross-country migration (Beine et al., 2016, Ramos and Suri?ach, 2017) and China’s cross-province emigration (Poncet, 2006, Bao et al., 2009, Bao et al., 2011), we empirically estimate the gravity equation of internal migration to examine the impacts of demographic shifts over cohorts. Specifically, we exploit within-prefecture variations in cohort sizes, controlling for prefecture-pair fixed effects and flexible trends in province pairs. Variations in demographic shifts were mainly caused by the famine-induced baby boom in the 1960s and subsequent birth-control policies in the 1970s and 1980s, both of which were determined decades ago before people made migration decisions. In addition, China’s household registration (hukou) system, which used to impose stringent migration control, only started to relax in the 1990s. Our sample period,1996–2010, covers a large portion of China’s recent migration history. The stringent migration control before the 1990s and the relaxation thereafter helped rule out the reverse effect of past migration flows on birth cohort sizes. As the prime migration decisions are made approximately 20 years after the fertility shifts that caused the birth cohort size changes, these changes can be treated as predetermined to migration. Therefore, the association between changes in prefecture-level cohort size and subsequent bilateral migration flows shall be mainly attributed to the change in the cohort size itself (Hanson and McIntosh, 2010). The unique empirical setting enables us to identify the causal effects of cohort sizes on migration flows between origin and destination prefectures in China. </s>"

The identification strategy used in this paper is to exploit the within-county temporal variation in gradually shifting local climate to identify the long-run impacts of climate change on agricultural land use. Region-by-year fixed effects and county fixed effects are employed to control for confounding effects.
The paper provides the first causal estimates on how long-run climate change affects total cropland areas and cropping patterns in China. It finds that climate change has spatially differentiated impacts on cropland areas, depending on the initial climate endowments in a region. </s><s>Assistant: This paper provides the first causal estimates on how long-run climate change affects total cropland areas and cropping patterns in China. We assemble a county-level panel dataset that tracks each county’s total cropland area and the planted areas specific to four major grain crops for more than 2,400 counties from 1981 to 2015 in China. For each county in each year, we use the averages of temperature and precipitation over its past 30 years to form measures of time-varying local climate (i.e., climate normals). Our identification of long-run climate change impacts on agricultural land use exploits the within-county temporal variation in the gradually shifting local climate rather than year-to-year variation in weather. By employing a rich set of region-by-year fixed effects on top of county fixed effects, we effectively control for confounding effects on cropland adjustments through channels irrelevant to long-run climate change. </s>"

First, how important is seed quality misperception in explaining low demand for high-quality seed? Second, to what extent and through which channels does the provision of quality information influence farmers' valuation of high-quality seed?

The identification strategy used in this paper is based on an experimental design where spousal observability of reported information is varied. Participants in the control group are informed that their responses will be kept private and not shared with their spouses, whereas participants in the treatment group are informed that their responses will be observable to and shared with their spouses. By comparing the information reported by the treatment and control groups, the paper aims to identify if strategic misreporting is the cause of information asymmetry between migrants and their spouses.
The core story of this paper is to analyze the extent of information asymmetry between migrants and their spouses in transnational households and determine if this can be explained by strategic misreporting. The paper finds that both migrants and their spouses have biased beliefs about each other's finances and that spouses staying behind underreport their income when it is observable to the migrant. The paper also identifies gender differences in information sharing, with women more likely to underreport income. These findings contribute to understanding household decision-making and have implications for financial products and services for transnational households. </s><s>Assistant: In this paper, I analyze if this information asymmetry can be explained by migrants and their spouses misreporting information to each other. I first document the extent of information asymmetry between migrants and their spouses staying behind across multiple margins. Next, I analyze information sharing between migrants and their spouses to determine if their reporting patterns are consistent with a theory of strategic misreporting. The defining characteristic of misreporting is that individuals are purposefully falsifying information making it inherently difficult to identify. I address this challenge by using a novel experimental strategy to vary spousal observability of reported information.

My research design is based on the simple idea that if migrants and their spouses strategically misreport information to each other, they will differentially report this information when it is observable to the other spouse compared to when it is not. I implement this design in the context of transnational households in the UAE-Philippines migration corridor. I invite married temporary Filipino migrants in the UAE and their spouses staying behind in the Philippines to separately participate in a survey. The survey is described to participants as a research activity to create awareness about the experience of Filipino migrants in the UAE and their households in the Philippines. In the survey, I collect data on income, expenses, and employment, with the migrant reporting their information in the UAE and the spouse staying behind reporting theirs in the Philippines. I elicit the causal effect of spousal observability by experimentally varying whether the information reported by an individual in the survey is observable to their spouse. Participants in the control group are informed that their responses will be kept private and not shared with their spouses, whereas participants in the treatment group are informed that their responses will be observable to and shared with their spouses. Information is shared, based on the treatment status, after all surveys have been completed. Participants know their treatment status when the information is collected. If migrants and their spouses strategically misreport information to each other, I should observe differences between the information reported by the treatment and the control groups. </s>"

This paper studies the causal long-run impacts of individual experiences on intimate partner violence. Specifically, we focus on exposure to collective gender-based violence and ask how wartime exposure to sexual violence against women affects veterans’ long-run propensity to commit intimate partner violence.

We study the impact of exposure to wartime sexual violence for two?main reasons. First, perpetrating or witnessing violence is often associated with engaging in violent behavior in the future – ‘violence begets violence’ (Pollak, 2004; Littman and Paluck, 2015). Second, sexual violence is among the most intense and recurring forms of gender-based violence and war atrocities,affecting millions of people across the world as victims and perpetrators. Starting with events in Bosnia and Rwanda, awareness for wartime sexual violence in the globalpolicy discourse has increased rapidly, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820 recognizes that “rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutiveact with respectto genocide” (UN, 2008, p. 3).

The paper contributes to the sparse literature identifying causal impacts of manufacturing work on the agency of women in poor countries. The combined shocks to textile demand from the US durig the 200809 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and the gradual phase-out of the MFA together resulted in a large, temporary, decline in RMG employment in Lesotho. Because of the lack of other well-paid employment for women, these shocks to RMG demand provide an opportunity to examine the impact of a high-wage, formalised work environment on women’s say in resource allocation in households and measures of women’s health. A pseudo-panel spanning 2004–2014 is constructed to identify causal impacts of RMG employment on these outcomes. Women who reside closer to potential RMG employment are more likely to work in the?sector. Exogenous variation in RMG employment propensities from the combination of distance between a woman’s residence and the nearest IZ and these demand shocks is exploited for inference.

The RMG sector began in the early 1980s with investments from South Africa. These investments were facilitated by the Lesotho National Development Cooperation. Investors could circumvent sanctions on South Africa which otherwise prevented selling to the US and European markets (UNCTAD, 2002, Steele, 2002, Gibbon, 2003). By 2004, the RMG sector had become the main non-agricultural employer in Lesotho, engaged more formal-sector workers than the government, and was the source of a majority of export revenue (Lall, 2006, International Finance Corporation, 2010). Under AGOA, foreign direct investment in Lesotho increased substantially (Central Bank of Lesotho, 2004, Central Bank of Lesotho, 2005). The sector is dominated by Taiwanese and South African-owned factories producing for the US market (Balchin and Calabrese, 2019, World Trade Organization, 2017). As of 2017, about 82% of workers were women. In 2017, the RMG sector employed about 46500 workers in Lesotho, down from a peak of 54 000 in early 2003 (Lesotho Ministry of Trade and Industry, 2017).

RMG production is concentrated primarily in the suburbs of Maseru, the national capital, and Thetsane, Mafeteng, Leribe and Mohale’s Hoek. The Maseru zone remains the largest employer, likely because transportation costs for finished goods are lowest from this location. The proximity of the Maseru suburbs to the railhead leading to the South African sea port of Durban also lowers lag time between orders and deliveries.

Wages and working conditions in the RMG sector are strongly regulated in Lesotho. A child labour ban is enforced by the government. RMG sector workers are also generally unionised, and may have access to on-site childcare and healthcare (Gibbon, 2003). Factories operating in the IZs pay much higher wages both relative to local alternatives and relative to those paid in other RMG host countries including Vietnam and Bangladesh. In 2007, the average monthly earnings of an employee in the RMG sector was $US 103, and the minimum monthly earnings for a general textile worker in Lesotho was $US 93 (RMG Bangladesh, 2016). In 2007, annual GDP per capita was far lower: 846 current US$, a monthly equivalent of 71 US$ (World Bank, 2022b). Still, production costs were internationally competitive in the early 2000s. Eifert et al. (2005) calculated the labour costs per shirt produced in Lesotho in 2004 as 0.19 current US dollars, far under the 0.65 for South Africa and 0.29 for export processing zones in China. The minimum monthly earnings for a textile worker had risen to $US 138 by August 2018 (Abdullah Al Mahfuz, 2018). </s>"

State expropriation is generally justified by the public interest. The state is expected to employ expropriation as a policy tool to provide?public goods and to develop the economy more generally.3 Since these goals deliver benefits to the public, whether expropriation has political costs, and if so, how detrimental the costs are, could be contextdependent. Public perceptions of the motivations for expropriation could influence the extent to which expropriation leads to adverse political impacts. To explore this relationship, this study examines two circumstances that may enable the state to implement expropriation projects without losing citizens’ political support. First, if local officials have a reputation for good governance, the expropriation projects are likely to be well managed and justified and the process of expropriation may be implemented in a manner which is more transparent. In this case, state expropriation may not necessarily have high political costs. Second, public use of the expropriated resources may be important. When the projects generate public benefits, the interests of both the government and the citizens are aligned and adverse political impacts may not emerge.

China provides an excellent empirical setting to study the political consequences of state expropriation. As the world’s largest developing country, China has employed land expropriation to support development policies for several decades. Local governments have the authority to seize agricultural land and provide relatively low compensation. It is striking that, according to the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a nationally representative longitudinal survey, the proportion of households who have had at least some of their land expropriated by 2018 was 30% (see Fig. 1). There is no doubt that land expropriation has contributed to China’s economic development and growth by facilitating infrastructure construction and urbanization.4 However, are there political costs associated with this development policy? And if so, is it possible for the government to mitigate the costs? Little is known quantitatively about these questions, although they are of great interest and policy relevance.

This paper argues that land expropriation incurs political costs for the Chinese government. The Wukan event, which attracted worldwide attention, provides a vivid illustration.5 In September 2011, Wukan villagers launched large-scale violent protests against the government after they discovered that the village and township governments transferred more than half of their agricultural land to a private real estate company without ex-ante negotiation or providing proper compensation to villagers. Some managers including the vice-CEO of the private company were village cadres, suggesting that corruption may have occurred at the local level.6 Before organizing the protests, the villagers?petitioned the provincial government but received no satisfactory resolution. After interacting with local government officials, some villagers were arrested and jailed; and one died after being arrested by the police. During the process, the villagers gradually lost their trust in the local government and called for an investigation by the central government. Finally, a peaceful agreement between the villagers and the government was reached after a top provincial leader intervened and acknowledged the villagers’ basic demands. </s>"

As a fundamental market force, product market competition has become more intense in recent decades. Waves of trade liberalization, including recent developments in China, have significantly shifted the domestic landscape of competition and induced firms to transform themselves in various ways (Bloom et al., 2016). We use the largesttrade liberalization in China, marked by China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001, to examine whether and how firms alter their ownership choices in response to trade-induced?competition.2 Abundant anecdotal evidence suggests that firm managers consider the nature and potential roles of ownersas a core aspectof their firms’ strategy sets and activelyconsider whether to adjust ownership to strengthen firms’ competitiveness. For example, Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, the largest construction machinery manufacturer and distributor in China, has actively sought to introduce strategic investors since 2002 to facilitate its structural reform, improve its technology management expertise and corporate governance, and raise capital.3 More recently, Suning.com, a large online retailer in China, introduced government-backed strategic investors to mitigate its financial distress and reduce operational frictions.4 Given the strategic roles that different ownership types can play in a competitiveenvironment, we hypothesize that certain changes in state and foreign shareholders are avenues for firms to strengthen their competitiveness. </s>"

Research suggests that in countries with a preference for boys, prenatal sex selection may be a substitute for forms of postnatal discrimination such as infanticide, malnourishment, and an overall lower level of investment in female children (Kalsi, 2015, Lin et al., 2014). Given the issue of substitution across forms of discrimination, policies aimed at reducing the demand for boys by targeting the underlying son preference are preferable to policies that restrict the supply of sex selection technologies. In this paper, I explore whether improving the status of women within society could reduce son preference.

I take advantage of a 1993 amendment to India's constitution, which established a three-tier system of rural governing local bodies (Panchayats) within each state. States were required to develop Panchayats at the village, the block, and the district level. The law also required that these newly developed Panchayats reserve one-third of all political positions, including those of chairpersons, for women. As a result, a state's adoption of the law led to a drastic increase in female political representation at local levels within the state. </s>"

The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether and how an increased participation of women in the decision-making body of local collective action institutions - the Executive Committee (EC) of Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) in Nepal - affects forest protection, specifically the quantity of firewood collected by the households.

Firewood extraction is considered as one of the main causes of deforestation and forest degradation (Baland et al., 2010, 2018; Edmonds, 2002). Therefore, a reduction in the quantity of firewood collected would imply better forest conditions. The hypothesis I want to test is whether a higher female representation in ECs of CFUGs contributes to better forest management and hence to forest protection.

Nepal is a particularly suitable country for this analysis. In 1993 the government of Nepal promulgated a Forest Act which established the transfer of national forests to local communities. Since then Community Forest User Groups (FUGs from now on) have been formed for the management and protection of these forests. These groups can autonomously manage the forests and decide on the distribution of benefits deriving from the forest resources.

The Executive Committee of each FUG plays a critical role in defining the forest products extraction rules and its composition is therefore crucial for the functioning and effectiveness of these institutions. I use two national representative household surveys, the 2004 and 2011 Nepal Living Standard Measurement Surveys, and combine them with a census of all FUGs formed in the country. This is a unique feature of the analysis.

In 2009 an amendment to the Community Forest programme's operational guidelines set at 50 percent the minimum threshold for female representation in the ECs of FUGs. Although the new policy was not legally binding, the new provision actually increased female participation within these local institutions. According to the census of FUGs, in groups formed after 2009 the average percentage of women in the ECs was 44 and 42 for groups formed in 2010 and 2011 respectively. In groups formed before 2010 the average proportion of women in the ECs ranged between 25 and 38 percent.

This study is motivated by the fact that minimal research has been devoted to exploring gender differences within community-based institutions established for natural resources management. However, women are largely responsible for the collection and use of firewood and other forest products within a household. Despite being important stakeholders in forest management, they are often neglected in the decision-making process that sets out the rules to access and collect forest products within a Community Forest (CF). This under-representation together with pre-existing gender inequalities within the household and the society as a whole, poses serious concerns for women who have the primary responsibility for the collection of forest products within the household (Agarwal, 2007). The recognition of the essential role that women play within community level forest institutions can make a difference in terms of forest conservation and equity in the distribution of benefits. </s>"

While some attention has been devoted to classical school inputs targeting equally all students in the classroom, these could be inadequate to help strengthening education quality.1 Targeting more and better school inputs to those students lagging behind could be the way to go, namely in settings where student heterogeneity is significant (Banerjee et al., 2007). At the same time, computer technology enabled pedagogical methods to be more tailored to the specific needs of individual students. Many programs have been trying to improve education quality in developing countries through the use of technology. However, experimental evidence from various parts of the world reviewed by Escueta et al. (2017) proves that simply providing schools with computers is unlikely to improve children’s academic performance. Differently, computer hardware combined with Computer-assisted Learning (CAL) software has demonstrated clear positive impacts on student achievement, in particular when individual customization of contents is possible, e.g., Muralidharan et al. (2019). Important questions do however remain about how to link these CAL programs to regular teachers and classroom dynamics. In particular, involving teachers could help a variety of outcomes including decreasing their absenteeism.

The context of our study is the capital city of Luanda, Angola.3 Angola is a suitable illustration of an expanded but low-performing school system. The Gross Enrollment Rate in Angola’s primary education grew from an estimated 71% in 1998 to 113% in 2015. However, in 2014 its youth literacy rate was close to the average of Sub-Saharan African countries, at 77% (World Bank, World Development Indicators, 2019). Sizeable heterogeneity in students’ abilities within each classroom is common. Hence, it is clear that the main challenge today in Angola, like in other African countries, is to increase the quality of education. </s>"

Specifically, we analyze the effect of a prominent aid program in China, the so-called 156 Program supported by the Soviet Union during the 1950s, on contemporary Sino-Russian trade patterns. Next, we offer a new mechanism to explain why the effect exists and persists after decades. The previous theory linking aid and trade relies mainly on the fact that the donor countries exert political influence on the recipients through aid programs to intentionally increase their economic dependence (Richardson, 1976; Roeder, 1985; Alesina and Dollar, 2000). However, since political influence might diminish as soon as aid programs are terminated, it can hardly explain the effects of aid in the long run. Instead, we posit that aid can build social capital, for example, in the form of affinity or trust between donors and recipients, which then facilitates long-term economic exchanges.

Next, we take a step toward understanding why aid continues to increase trade after several decades.   Although a bunch of channels may be relevant, a definitive accounting of the role of each channel is beyond the scope of our study.   Instead, we aim to strengthen a specific interpretation that aid fosters intergroup affinity or trust, which may further facilitate bilateral trade in the long run.   In the spirit of Guiso et al. (2009), trust has important implications on economic exchanges, including bilateral trade, direct investment, and portfolio investment.   Previous studies also find positive effects of bilateral affinity on trade in various contexts (e.g., Disdier and Mayer, 2007;   Michaels and Zhi, 2010). </s>"

Historical records provide evidence that French and British colonial practices affected women on the two sides of the border in significantly different ways. Several British colonial policies created new educational and occupational opportunities for women. For example, girls benefited from a protestant education system that aimed at educating both girls and boys, and women gained opportunities to earn cash wages in the export oriented agriculture sector, under the same conditions as their male counterparts. In contrast, the French colonial practice in these domains centered around educating a small administrative elite and investing in the male employment dominated infrastructure sector, to build railways and roads.

Despite the many positive impacts associated with these reforms, their contributions to promoting women's engagement in the local economy remain uncertain. These relationships are critical for identifying the short- and long-term impact of such policies.

We consider in particular the role of women in the manufacturing sector from 1994 to 2005. The unorganized sector of Indian manufacturing is comprised of establishments with fewer than 10 employees (or fewer than 20 if the establishment does not use electricity). Our data report gender-based ownership and employment in unorganized manufacturing establishments by state and industry in 1994, 2000 and 2005. The unorganized sector is of particular interest as it has constituted approximately 99% and 80% of total manufacturing establishment counts and employment in India consistently since the early 1990s. We also observe gender-based employment in the organized sector, which is comprised of all plants above the indicated employment thresholds. On the whole, the female ownership share of Indian manufacturing business more than doubled during our period of study: in 1994, female-owned businesses comprised 9% of total manufacturing employment; by 2005, this share had grown tremendously to 19% (Ghani et al., 2013c). Therefore it is of crucial importance to understand more deeply the factors that have contributed to this sharp emergence of female entrepreneurship and business ownership over a relatively short time period. </s>"

This enduring and important paradox in the literature has been called the “Asian enigma” (Ramalingaswami et al., 1996). India's height deficit relative to Africa is large: it is about two-fifths as large as the average rural-urban height gap in India, and almost one-quarter as large as the average difference in India between children of literate and illiterate mothers. This defecit impacts many people because 19% of births occur in India.

Sanitation, when poor, can be a key determinant of human capital in developing countries. This is because germs from feces cause diarrhea and other diseases, which can consume energy and harm the overall nutrition of growing children and of the mothers who nurture them in pregnancy and early life. Medical research indicates that chronic environmental exposure to fecal germs could be an important cause of growth deficits. This paper documents a large and robust gradient between exposure to open defecation and child height. As we show, sanitation can explain international variation in child height that income and other dimensions of development cannot. Our main conclusion is that open defecation can statistically account for much or all of the average height-for-age difference between India and Africa, in the sense that children in India are projected to be taller by at least as much as the gap, if counterfactually exposed to the African distribution of open defecation density.

Over one billion people worldwide defecate in the open (meaning without using any toilet or latrine), most of these in India (Coffey and Spears, 2017). For reasons related to the history and endurance of the caste system, sanitation coverage is exceptionally poor in India, a densely populated country where most people1 defecate in the open. This is a much larger prevalence of open defecation than in other countries with similar economic status. Perhaps surprisingly in light of how much open defecation there is, and how different sanitation in India is from sanitation elsewhere, sanitation received little prior attention in economists' wide-ranging investigations of the puzzle of Indian malnutrition and stunting (e.g. Deaton, 2007; Tarozzi, 2008; Jensen, 2012; Panagariya, 2013). </s>"

In recent decades, however, as China has become wealthier and pollution problems have created large dissatisfaction among the public, pollution reduction has become a high priority for the government. In 2014, at the Communist party's annual congress, Premier Li Keqiang declared war on air pollution in China. At the party congress in 2017, he renewed his vow to “make our skies blue again.” As China has published a series of policies and plans aimed at addressing environmental problems, the urgent question to answer is as follows: Who will bear the cost? Unlike developed countries where the cost and benefit analysis has long been considered in the policy design process, policymakers in developing countries such as China have only recently begun to pay attention to the potential costs of environmental policies. With the increasing intensity of environmental governance, China's already heavy burden under which it must constantly create new jobs simply to prevent unemployment from increasing may become even heavier. Therefore, estimating the potential impacts of air pollution control on employment, identifying vulnerable groups, and providing corresponding policy recommendations in China is particularly urgent. </s>"

This article aims to evaluate the responses and adaptations of agricultural TFPs to climate change in China, which is the largest global emitters and largest developing country boasting the largest agricultural economy and population.  China’s mitigation policy aims at reducing GHG emissions intensity, through industrial structure adjustment, energy consumption structure optimization, energy efficiency improvement, carbon sequestration capacity enhancement, and pilot carbon trading, among others.  By 2017, carbon intensity in China had dropped by about 46% compared with 2005.  In terms of adaptation policies, apart from China’s National Climate Change Programme, we have been unable to find policies at the national level specifically targeting agricultural adaptation to climate change.  However, some other policies, such as the “One Exemption and Three Subsidies” policy,2 are not only designed to ensure food security and increase farmers’ income, but also improve agricultural adaptation to climate change.  This is because they not only encourage innovation and adoption of heat-resistant and drought-resistant species that can reduce productivity loss, but also motivate more investments in agriculture.  Understanding how these policies mitigate agricultural losses in the context of global warming through two channels including productivity and input utilization, is of great significance for developing more effective adaptation policies.  Hence, this article also aims to identify the mechanism by which climate change affects yield through its impact on TFP and input utilization, as well as the mechanism of adaptation behaviors of Chinese farmers.The data used for this study comes from two sources.  On the one hand, a county-year panel data for 2495 counties consisting of specific agricultural inputs and outputs over the period of 1981–2015 is used to construct four agricultural TFP measures under various specifications to rule out the effect of labor, fertilizer and machinery on yield.  On the other hand, comprehensive daily weather records from 820 weather stations are merged to these 2495 counties using the inverse distance weighting method (IDW), which makes it possible to further investigate how inputs and TFPs are affected by climate change. </s>"

China's substantially strengthened enforcement of green credit regulations in 2012 further provide an excellent opportunity to identify the causal effect of green credit on firms' external financial conditions through a difference-in-difference strategy. Given the limited regulatory capacity of governments,2 the potential of the financial sector in environmental protection was re-affirmed and substantially enhanced by the Guideline on Green Credit, enacted in February 2012 in China. In contrast to pure market mechanisms spontaneously adopted by banks, such as the Equator Principle, green credit in China features pressures on banks which are obliged to account for environmental risks. Any failure to adhere to the rules might trigger sanctions on banks and are likely to detrimentally impact banks' achievement assessments, which serve as important bases for governmental regulatory ratings of banks, banks' market access and their managers' achievement evaluation. Therefore, echoing Foster and Gutierrez (2013) who find that voluntary certification can provide an important complement to mandatory inspections as a basis for environmental regulation in low-income countries, our investigation on the effect of green credit in the context of China's green credit mechanism also helps to determine the role that financial markets can play, especially in an environment with limited government capacity. </s>"

This study attempts to bridge this gap by documenting novel empirical evidence and measuring the benefits of fuel standards in the largest developing country, China. More precisely, it investigates the relationship between China's fuel standards, which specify lower sulfur content, and levels of air pollution. There are three reasons for this focus. First, China has become the world's largest automobile market. There has been an unprecedented increase in the country's vehicle ownership, shown in Fig. 1. Intensive oil consumption is associated with a large number of externalities (Parry et al., 2007). China's cities rank among the most polluted in the world (World Bank, 2007; Greenstone and Hanna, 2014; Chen et al., 2013; Cropper, 2010). That makes regulating fuel content of great policy relevance. Second, uniform fuel standards have gradually been introduced in Chinese cities, which provides a new opportunity to understand their environmental implications. The different standards together with accurate data allow overcoming methodological obstacles that have impeded progress in this field.

Third, Chinese fuel standards generally follow the practices of Europe, Japan and the United States. Very similar regulations facilitate meaningful international comparisons of policy effectiveness. Apart from the detailed insights into the role of policy in the current setting, some general lessons could emerge which would enrich our view of fuel content regulations in a broader context. </s>"

Our analysis leverages a novel source of high-resolution satellite data on night-time boat detection in Vietnam's marine exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and relates it to employment data from the Vietnamese labor force surveys. Exploiting both the industry-specific and location-specific natures of the Formosa shock, our identification strategy compares fishery workers that lived in the affected region to both non-fishery workers in the same area and other fishery workers outside the affected zone. //研究内容

Our paper focuses on evaluating the short-run, immediate impacts of Formosa on fishery workers, and how the affected fishers adapted to this extreme shock to their livelihoods, for at least two important reasons. First, fishery is the third-most dominant sector in Vietnam, accounting for 19.97 percent of the country's total agricultural GDP in 2016 and 9–10 percent total export revenues (General Statistics Office, 2016b). Fishery-related activities also make up a considerable share of the economics in the central Vietnam. At the four-digit Vietnam Standard Industrial Classification (VSIC) level, the single sub-industry of saltwater fishery accounts for 3.8 and 7.3 percent of total employment and income in coastal districts2 of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Hue in 2015 (General Statistics Office, 2016a). Second, the Vietnamese fishery sector is characterized as being predominantly small-scale and concentrated in coastal near-shore waters (Pomeroy et al., 2009).3 Due to this nature of the industry, majority of Vietnamese fishers face considerable restriction on the length and types of their fishing voyage. Fishery earnings are also highly vulnerable to uncertainties in fishing condition—from unfavorable climates to extreme, albeit rare, incidents like Formosa. Because we are interested in examining the immediate impact of the crisis, we confine the scope of the analysis to the period before any formal source of compensation was distributed, i.e., the rest of 2016.4 The time frame of our analysis allows us to cleanly evaluate fishery economic damages and adaptation activities during the most urgent time, thereby providing insights related to the timing, effectiveness, and equality of assistance policies. </s>"

As their frequency and intensity increase geometrically over time, storms constitute a major avenue of change in political conditions. We start with the observation that major natural shocks typically increase pre-existing group disparities and induce political exclusions and societal grievances via their enormous fatalities and overwhelming material destruction. In their aftermath, if governments fail to adequately compensate victims for their losses, survivors may stage protests, exhibit anti-government political behavior, and even launch massive insurgencies.3 Thus, when a disaster with such implications occurs, the government faces a dilemma: either incur the cost of a major disaster relief effort or confront the cost of a possible insurgency, with the consequent possibility of being overthrown. In most cases, the government rightfully deems the latter cost larger, especially if the government itself is not an autocratic one, because such governments cannot effectively fight attempts to overthrow them.

Based on this intuition, our stylized dynamic game-theoretic model of citizen–government interactions in the wake of storms yields a unique equilibrium whereby the government opts to deliver to citizens adequate and effective post-disaster relief, as a result of which citizens refrain from insurgency even if the government resorts to autocracy. Consequently, the incumbent government can tighten its grip over the polity by increasing state control in the aftermath of the shock. This means that storms end up provoking autocratic tendencies through a mutually-agreed political repression, generating a specific type of political regime for which we coin the name “storm autocracies”. </s>"

The end of this trade-related uncertainty has triggered exceptional export growth in China (Pierce and Schott, 2016, Feng et al., 2017) and had wide-ranging economic consequences (e.g., Facchini et al., 2019, Liu and Ma, 2020, Erten and Leight, 2021). </s>"

For example, in the historical context of the United States, it has been argued that transportation infrastructure gives rise to more cities, which then turned into “engines” of growth for the country as a whole.1 On the other hand, transportation infrastructure increases the access of rural regions to cities, and the well-known agglomeration effects of cities may cause productive capital and skilled labor to move from rural regions to cities over time, with the result that those who remain in rural areas receive very limited benefits from urbanization or even become impoverished. Along similar lines, it has been argued that the expansion of motor road networks in the United States promoted large-scale suburbanization and left many cities without a viable economic model (Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2009). </s>"

The subnational regions with comparatively high rates of mobility are found to be less residentially segregated, have lower inequality, higher quality public school systems, stronger social networks, and stronger family structures.

In addition, vocational education may not grant equal access to higher education, where general education does.

Firstly, it is virtually impossible for an agent in the illegal market to formally employ anyone. As a result, agents resort to informal labor, where there are no institutions mediating employer–employee relationships; this is particularly true in rural, poor, and isolated sites, where workers generally have little bargaining power to set favorable work conditions. Secondly, modern slavery often involves violence and life threats, where perpetrators hold enslaved individuals as prisoners (Sakamoto, 2006). This is supported by empirical evidence, such as Chimeli and Soares (2017), which found that the shutdown of the mahogany market increased homicides. Additionally, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence which indicates how violence is used in the illegal mahogany market, with loggers having access to illegal weapons and frequently threatening those who resist the logging. Therefore, the cost of committing further crimes is much lower in an illegal and unregulated market than in a legal one. </s>"

On the one hand, it is a country with a relatively high gender wage gap, especially at the bottom of the wage distribution. In 2014, the difference between the earnings of full-time employed men and full-time employed women amounted to 17.2 percent in Germany, placing it in the upper third of countries with the highest gaps, above the OECD average (see Fig. 1a).2 At the first decile of the wage distribution, Germany even shows a wage difference of 18.2% in 2014, placing it among the eight countries with the highest gaps among low-income earners, and well above the United States and the United Kingdom (see Fig. 1b). It is thus evident that Germany suffers from high gender wage discrepancies in an OECD comparison, especially among low-wage earners.3 On the other hand, Germany introduced a nationwide minimum wage in 2015, which was set at a comparably high level and had only few exemptions.4 With € 8.50 gross per hour, it ranked among the highest wage floors in Europe in terms of purchasing power (Caliendo et al., 2019). Its level is to be re-evaluated every two years, and it was increased to € 8.84 in January 2017, being followed by additional increases in 2019 and the subsequent years (Mindestlohnkommission, Mindestlohnkommission, Mindestlohnkommission). Caused by its high initial value, the reform affected about four million employees, i.e. about ten percent of the eligible workers (Destatis, 2016). Among them, women were vastly overrepresented, since they accounted for two-thirds of affected employees (Burauel, Caliendo, Fedorets, Grabka, Schr?der, Schupp, Wittbrodt, 2017, Mindestlohnkommission). This has been attributed to insufficient regulations of the low-pay sector and gender segregation, which lead to an unequal coverage of collective bargaining agreements for men and women (Grimshaw, Rubery, 2013, Herzog-Stein, Lübker, Pusch, Schulten, Watt, 2018). Accordingly, the introduction of the wage floor could have an influence on gender inequality. In a simulation study, Boll et al. (2015) predict that in the absence of job losses, the minimum wage could reduce the average gender wage gap in Germany by 2.5 percentage points; and with job losses, the effect could even be larger. This points to a potential caveat, namely that low-paid women quitting or losing their jobs could cause a decrease in the gap. However, since all ex-post evaluation studies find only small employment effects and no strong evidence of gender-specific job-losses (see, e.g., Bonin, Isphording, Krause, Lichter, Pestel, Rinne, Caliendo, Obst, Preuss, Schr?der, Grabka, Caliendo, Schr?der, Wittbrodt, 2019, Pestel, Bonin, Isphording, Gregory, Caliendo), this does not seem to be an issue in Germany. </s>"

Willingness to pay (WTP) for well-being frequently depends on factors that enter the utility function directly (e.g., the probability of mortality, school quality, local crime rates, etc.) and compensatory investments that help to determine these factors (Grossman 1972). In a wide variety of contexts, the empirical literature has almost exclusively focused on the direct effects (e.g., health outcomes) of these factors and left the defensive investments largely unmeasured. As examples, there has been little effort to measure: the use of medications or air filters to protect against poor air quality (e.g., Chay and Greenstone 2003; Currie and Neidell 2005); parental expenditures on supplemental tutoring to improve educational outcomes for their children; or the costs of alarm systems and additional security to protect against crime.  </s>"

Driven by a new round of technology, the integration of traditional finance and technology continues to deepen, and financial technology emerges as the times require. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) defines financial technology as financial innovation enabled by technology. Moreover, financial technology can create new financial models and products, and reshape financial operation processes and applications, thereby having an important impact on financial markets, financial institutions and financial operations. Compared with traditional finance, with the empowerment of big data, cloud computing, blockchain, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and other technologies, the service efficiency of financial technology has been significantly improved. Moreover, the financial transaction boundary of financial institutions expands outwards and has significant decentralization characteristics [1]. Its innovative advantage lies in breaking the time and space limitations existing in the traditional financial model, getting rid of the constraints of physical outlets and manual services on financial services, and greatly reducing the cost of financial services, search costs and matching costs. Therefore, financial technology has the characteristics of inclusive finance, that is, ""financial services are available"", ""financing is available"" and ""financial infrastructure is universal"" [2]. However, the essence of financial technology is still finance, and its core function is still resource allocation. It uses modern Internet technology to innovate financial models and improve the efficiency of financial services. Therefore, financial technology also has financial risks, and compared with traditional financial models, in addition to traditional financial risks, there are also technical risks caused by technological empowerment. </s>"

First, there is larger scholarly impact, in terms of citations, from Henderson et al.

Two caveats to that potential advantage are that night lights do better at predicting differences in economic variables over space than changes in those variables over time (Nordhaus and Chen, 2015; Goldblatt et al., 2020; Gibson and Boe-Gibson, 2020), and the time-series is old, with DMSP data stopping in 2013 while VIIRS data are available monthly with only a slight lag.3 Also, economists may have more slowly switched to using VIIRS night lights data, compared to other disciplines, because flaws in DMSP data are rarely highlighted in the economics literature. The remote sensing literature has several comparisons that highlight the superiority of VIIRS (e.g. Elvidge et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2014; Chen and Nordhaus, 2015, 2019) but these studies are rarely cited in economics journals. </s>"

A broad range of studies have highlighted the adverse effects of air pollution on many outcomes, including crime (Burkhardt et al., 2020; Herrnstadt et al., 2021), labor productivity (Borgschulte et al., 2022) and other human behaviors (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2009), in the short and long run (Archsmith et al., 2018). More recent evidence in eco nomics demonstrates that exposure to air pollution can have adverse effects on the development of cognitive function and exacerbate the expression of anti-social behaviors associated with violence (Burkhardt et al., 2019; Sager, 2019; Walters, 2014). Accordingly, the possible underlying mechanism is that air pollution may alter the emotional disposition or risk preferences of individuals via some biological processes. Because of China’s extreme emphasis on maintaining social stability (i.e., “stability trumps everything” said by Deng Xiaoping), engaging in social conflicts, even for wage disputes, becomes a risky action. Thus, risk preferences, if associated with air pollution, could serve as a promising channel through which individuals’ decisions to participate in risky actions, such as social conflicts, may be affected. Individuals with increased risk preferences, under the influence of air pollution, may be more prone to being triggered. Thus, we first turn to the previous literature on medical and public health to reveal plausible mechanisms to establish the causal link between pollution exposure and social conflicts.

The medical and public health literature shows that air pollution might cause a series of physiological effects, which plausibly increase aggressive behaviors and contribute to violent crimes. For example, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can directly trigger an inflammatory response in the central nervous system (Block and Calderon-Garcidue ′ nas, ? 2009), which is closely linked with aggression, anxiety and depression (Herrnstadt et al., 2021) and even lead to criminal or violent activities (Lu et al., 2018). Long-term exposure to particulate matter and ozone is closely associated with reduced pulmonary function (Xu et al., 2021). Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin, reducing the amount of absorbed oxygen and impairing coordination and cognition (Amitai et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2018a). Furthermore, pollution exposure may result in various biological outcomes, as documented in the medical literature (Herrnstadt et al., 2021), including elevated levels of stress hormones (Li et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2013), reduced perceived control, increased impulsiveness, and changes in certain personality traits, such as time preferences (Lu et al., 2018; Power et al., 2015; Riis-Vestergaard et al., 2018; Sass et al., 2017). The latter outcome, i.e., time preferences, is related to the perceived risks and payoffs of violent behaviors (Bondy et al., 2020). In summary, if such pollution-related biological mechanisms are at play, exposure to air pollution, even in the short term, could be biologically linked to aggressive behaviors, eventually leading to increased social conflicts. In economics, several studies have explored links similar to those discussed in this paper, revealing potential mechanisms that may be at play. For instance, Sager (2019) demonstrates that how these channels can impair cognitive skills involved in driving performance, resulting in a 0.3–0.6% increase in the number of road traffic accidents per day for each additional 1 μg∕m3 of PM2.5 in the United Kingdom. Burkhardt et al. (2019) find that a 10% increase in same-day exposure to PM2.5 and ozone is associated with 0.14% and 0.3% increases in violent crimes, respectively. Moreover, exposure to air pollution could also be linked to negative emotions, which could underlie aggressive behaviors. For example, Zhang et al. (2017) show that air pollution reduces hedonic happiness and increases the rate of depressive symptoms.

It represents distinctive characteristics that, ceteris paribus, can determine the success or failure of a firm compared to its peers (El-Bannany, 2008). In the knowledge-based socio-economic period where IC is considered as one of the production factors, it is not surprising that IC has been much[1]received attention from many researchers from different disciplines, especially management, accounting, and finance. While several studies have attempted to define IC from a theoretical perspective (Bontis, 1998; Wu & Tsai, 2005), others have developed effective measures of IC-based performance (Pulic, 2000) or explored the relationship between IC efficiency and some key characteristics of firms, industries, and regions (El-Bannany, 2008; Liang et al., 2011). The last strand focuses on empirically examining the effect of IC efficiency on financial performance. Despite many studies on this strand, there are a limited number of studies that attempt to test this link in the banking sector. It is acknowledged that the banking industry is one of the most knowledge-intensive industries (Firer & Mitchell Williams, 2003; Mavridis & Kyrmizoglou, 2005) and represents an ideal setting for research on IC. One may argue that banks may gain valuable competitive advantages by tightening their relationship with their customers and making valuable investments in soft information production (Boot, 2000). Other studies however emphasize that an efficient IC is more important for achieving success in banking than other industries since the higher quality of products and/services offered to customers depends on the bank’s investments associated with IC such as human resources, brand building, systems, and processes. Hence, banks should manage their IC as efficiently as possible. </s>"

With the development of technology and increasing social awareness of responsibility, CSR has been increasingly regarded as a vital competitive strategy for firms to mitigate risk (e.g., Godfrey 2005). Nevertheless, whether idiosyncratic risk (IR) in stock prices—an important financial indicator accounting for 85% of total risk (Goyal and Santa-Clara 2003)—can be reduced by engaging in CSR activities remains unclear. Notably, IR is the volatility of a company’s stock price caused by specific events (e.g., oil spills or labor strikes) that mainly influence only that company (Bansal and Clelland 2004, Luo and Bhattacharya 2009). Different from IR (or unsystematic risk), systematic risk refers to the sensitivity to deflation, exchange rate adjustment, and other common market changes that can affect all stocks (Luo and Bhattacharya 2009), and it accounts for the rest of total risk (15%). As such, investors and managers are more concerned about IR than about systematic risk. In particular, as IR is an important component of shareholder wealth (Srinivasan and Hanssens 2009), investors are more willing to choose stocks with a lower IR than those with a higher IR. Managers also care about IR, as companies with high IR often have difficulty in obtaining a stable cash flow and in developing new businesses. This may influence their ability to service debt and thus lead to company failure (Bansal and Clelland 2004). Therefore, IR is a vital risk that firms must consider and we focus on how CSR influences firm IR. </s>"

Currently, approximately 70,000 multinational personnel, also known as Blue Helmets, are deployed in 12 operations across the world, tasked with maintaining or enforcing peace. Despite facing a persistent shortage of resources and the failure to protect civilians in some emblematic cases, such as Rwanda, large-N studies demonstrate that peacekeeping has a positive effect on reducing violence in ongoing civil wars and the likelihood of conflict reoccurrence, even in the most challenging contexts (e.g., Beardsley 2011; Bove et al., 2020; Di Salvatore and Ruggeri 2017; Hegre et al., 2019; Hultman et al., 2013; Ruggeri et al., 2017). Peacekeepers also contribute to household well-being by revitalizing economic exchanges, promoting labour market participation, and building confidence and trust (Beber et al., 2019; Bove and Elia, 2018; Bove et al., 2021; Carnahan et al., 2006; Caruso et al., 2017; Cil et al., 2019; Nomikos 2022).1 The presence of peacekeepers has also a positive effect on maternal health outcomes, reducing maternal mortality rates and increasing access to services and education for women (Gizelis and Cao 2021).

UN peacekeeping missions are crucial in ensuring that basic public services, including medical services, are available and accessible by vulnerable populations. This is due to the security they provide. In addition, they oftentimes directly provide essential healthcare equipment and products.2 Indeed, contemporary UN interventions are not limited to keeping the peace – they aim at building sustainable and long-term peace (Campbell and Di Salvatore, 2023).3 This implies that the presence of UN peacekeepers not only offers a reduction in violence, but also the security umbrella essential to the provision of and access to basic public services and to the revival of the local economic activites. This article focuses on how peacekeeping operations, by enabling NGOs and governments to function more effectively and promoting revitalization of economic activities, are expected to affect fertility rates. Indeed, this enhanced peace provided by UN interventions creates a qualitative difference from post-conflict settings where peace is present but access to services may still be lacking. </s>"

Finding_III:The APRP has shown positive average treatment effects on participating households' economic outcomes, with households receiving housing vouchers experiencing different effects compared to those moving into public housing communities. </s><s>Assistant: 
In addition to a positive ATT, we document substantial heterogeneity in the effects, which aligns with our conceptual framework predictions. First, we find that the treatment effect on economic outcomes is smaller for households receiving housing vouchers than those who moved into public housing communities. This heterogeneity can be explained by the fact that households who chose housing vouchers had more kids and relocated to places with better access to educational resources. Higher amenities compensate for wage differences, encouraging some households without a comparative advantage in the non-agricultural sector to participate in the program. Second, moving into public housing communities has no significant positive impact on the labor supply of those with relatively low potential income in the labor market, including women, those who did not work in the previous year, and those with severe health issues. Heterogeneous effects on different groups of people are consistent with the Roy-model perspective, according to which comparative advantage in the non-agricultural sector determines the gain in potential income.

Notably, identifying the critical mechanism that decreases the switching cost from the agricultural to the non-agricultural sector with a short-distance relocation is the primary objective. We exploit the variation that participants who move to the same relocation community may come from different villages. For households in the same relocation community, access to the labor market, geographic conditions, transportation, etc., are all the same after treatment. Variations come before relocation, which is exogenous to households because selfrelocation across villages is rare among poor households. Also, any?effect of belonging to a particular village is eliminated by comparing participants and non-participants in the same village. Pre-treatment environment determines how restricted and isolated the Identified Poor Households (IPHs) are. With this variation, we find that households from villages with a lower average income, a lower proportion of wage in household income, and a more rugged terrain benefit more from relocation. Overall, access to non-agricultural sectors before treatment, which is in turn affected by geographic conditions, determines the treatment effect. We exclude some potential mechanisms, including extra job opportunities provided post-treatment, exposure to wealthier IPHs, and improved housing quality.

Finally, we conduct a cost–benefit analysis of the APRP by comparing the fiscal expenditure of the program with the increase in participants’ life-cycle potential income. A back-of-the-envelope calculation denotes that the APRP generates a net benefit to the economy when the counterfactual per capita income growth rate exceeds 6.45%. Our estimate likely underestimates the long-run benefit on the next generation (Chetty et al., 2016; Chyn, 2018), as we estimate the short-run effect of the program, given data limitations. Besides, the distributional benefit of the APRP, which is potentially substantial, is not considered. Future research is required </s>"

Finding_II:Competition for resources among armed groups leads to an increase in violence.
Finding_III:The capacity effect of an additional armed group on political violence is negative, but armed groups can compensate by altering their strategies. </s><s>Assistant: 
We estimate that an additional active armed group increases the quantity of political violence between 50% and 80% and the severity of violence (the sum of individuals wounded or killed) between 50% and 100%. The results suggest that the competition effect (for publicity, recruits, and/or financing) between armed groups dominates on average in our setting. Concerns about unobserved confounders explaining the UBA formation are relatively small since the general goals, target audience, primary opponent, and tactics of the BLA and UBA are similar.5 Moreover, we do not find evidence that our results are driven by infighting between armed groups, increased counter-insurgency efforts by the government, changes in politically disenfranchised populations, or local financing opportunities.

Taking our analysis to the group level, we leverage the UBA split from the BLA to (i) test for the capacity effect experienced by the BLA and (ii) investigate how the BLA allocates its attacks in response to increased competition. We show that the BLA primarily conducts additional attacks in districts in which other groups, as well as the ?UBA, are active. Hence, we can rule out that increased violence is driven by competition between the BLA and UBA alone. Moreover, we document that the BLA conducts more non-capital intensive attacks following its split, which provides suggestive evidence that the split is indeed a negative capacity shock. However, the fatalities inflicted by the BLA, both in absolute terms and relative to other groups operating within the same district, do not decrease. Hence, the BLA seems to be able to compensate for the negative capacity effect by switching strategies, which is in line with theoretical predictions of Bueno de Mesquita (2013). </s>"

Finding_III:The study provides evidence that domestic violence may be expressive behavior, originating from individual experiences in the past. </s><s>Assistant: 
Our central result is that a man ’s exposure to wartime sexual violence against women as a soldier significantly increases his pro pensity to commit violence against a female intimate partner more than a decade after the end of the war and, on average, about 18 years after exposure. We contend that this effect is not driven by local effects, omitted individual variables, measurement error, linear model specification, mis-specified inter-correlations in the error term or the choice of our preferred instrumental variable specification.

We present empirical evidence to argue that the underlying mechanism is a lasting reduction in self-control, fostering more impulsive and automatic responses to critical situations with their partner. Surprisingly, we find no support for alternative theories based on living up to norms of gender, social models of violence, distress or a reduction in economic bargaining power, which have dominated explanations of intimate partner violence in across disciplines. Our findings are consistent with an interpretation of IPV as ‘expressive’ behavior, where men intrinsically value the expression of violence and violent acts may arise as an unintended outcome. </s>"

Finding_II:Job-seekers revise their beliefs about employment prospects based on search experience.
Finding_III:Reducing transport costs can lead to job-seekers settling for lower-paying jobs in their own township. </s><s>Assistant: 
We find that providing job search subsidies reduced search costs as participants in the treatment group searched more intensively than those in the control group, by travelling more frequently and by covering a wider geographic area in the job search. This occurs even when the subsidy is unconditional and does not need to be spent on travel, suggesting that the job-seekers genuinely believe that transportation is a constraint. We then find that job-seekers who travel more intensively in search of jobs revise their beliefs in line with their search experience: treated job-seekers update their beliefs about their employment prospects, leading to a decrease in salary expectations (5%) and in reservation wages (8%). They revise downward the probability of getting a high-paying job in the city and they report a significant increase (23%) in their valuation of existing jobs, measured by the expected number of days job-seekers think it would take for them to find another job, if they were to lose the one they had. Finally, in line with their downgraded beliefs, job-seekers were more impatient (a 15% change relative to the control group) and more likely to search in their own township relative to the control group (by a factor of 2). This redirection of search towards the township results in them being 9% percentage points (a 77% change relative to the control at endline) more likely to settle for a lower-paying job in their own township, despite having reported a preference for a job in the city centre at baseline. This effect is driven primarily by the 64% of job-seekers who at baseline held strong beliefs about the importance of travelling to prospective employers and dropping their CVs as an effective job search strategy.9 Jobs in the township are even scarcer than in the city centre and those in the control group who manage to search unsubsidized in the city centre are positively selected on skill and are more likely to be male so levels of actual employment end up being similar across treatment and control groups twelve months after the start of our intervention. The main difference is that those who settle on a township job are paid less and wages increase much more slowly for jobs in the township, so our (rough and ready) calculation suggests that this switch may come at a very substantial loss of life-time earnings.
Our findings reveal that imperfect information about employment prospects and on how to find a job is pervasive and that because information is multi-dimensional, it is hard to correct through increased access to the labour market alone.11 In environments characterized by high transport costs to areas where the good jobs are located, many jobseekers believe that their best strategy is to apply in person whenever they have a chance. But temporarily reducing transport costs to give them a chance to apply may not improve employment outcomes, while also potentially leading to the wrong lesson being learned. When the external access constraint is lifted, job-seekers search intensively, but given that jobs are scarce and job-seekers may be mistargeting, many of them will find that jobs fail to materialize immediately. The inference from this experience depends on their priors. In particular, if they start by believing that there are enough jobs and that the key strategy to find them is to travel to the city centre and leave CVs with prospective employers, then the failure to find their desired job after searching intensively might lead them to blame their own lack of skills or to grow impatient with the search process. These are, in fact, the patterns we observe in the data. This implies that policies to support job-seekers in low-income settings characterized by significant spatial asymmetries of information might need to include de-biasing interventions alongside investments to increase access to the labour market, so as to optimally guide job-seekers in the job search and mitigate mistargeting (Altmann et al., 2018). </s>"

We find no effect of calls by either private or government teachers on mathematics or language test scores. This is robust to controls for student characteristics and school fixed effects, and differences in survey mode (in-person or phone). We do find some positive effects of tutoring calls on educational engagement by parents and children. Tutoring calls increase an index of student activity by 0.29 standard deviations and an index of parent activity by 0.27 standard deviations. Within this index, however, we see no statistically significant effect on the probability that children listened to educational radio, and only a 4 percentage point increase (significant at the 10 percent level) in the probability that their parent knew the correct FM frequency.

Re-enrolment was over 99 percent even in the control group, so we see no effect of calls on re-enrolment. Private school teachers (who were directly managed by the project implementer) did exert greater effort than the government school teachers. Private school teachers placed 59 percent of planned calls, compared to 41 percent for government school teachers. But this extra effort did not translate to any difference in student outcomes. This lack of a difference in outcomes across implementers – despite a difference in implementation fidelity suggests that the null finding results not from an implementation failure but in the effectiveness of the intervention itself. Many students did not listen to educational radio at all (43 percent in the control group and 34 percent in the treatment group), so low uptake of the educational radio is potential part of the reason for a lack of impact on student learning. </s>"

Combining administrative geo-spatial data with large agricultural surveys and using a generalized difference-in-difference (GDD) strategy that exploits the staggered roll out of the roads and extension, I find that, while ineffective in isolation, extension and roads have complementary effects on agricultural productivity. I show that in villages with access to both extension and roads, farmers are more likely to use agricultural advice, credit and modern inputs. In addition, farmers specialize in crops and trade across villages in line with their relative advantages with respect to access to markets and technologies. In the villages that get a road without the technologies provided under extension, households reduce total area cultivated and are more likely to shift to non-farm occupations. While extension and roads increase farm income on average, the improvements are concentrated in the villages that have access to both factors.

The results on the strong complementarity between extension and road are robust to exhaustive checks. While the baseline analysis defines road access based on whether the village is intersected by a road, the main findings are similar when using a market access measure that takes into account the full road network and the distribution of population in all Ethiopian villages. I also find that the main results are similar when considering a second identification strategy that combines the GDD design with an instrumental variable for market access based on least cost predicted network that aims to isolate the exogenous variation in market access induced by regional budget constraints and topography. Furthermore, I show the results are robust to alternative definitions of extension access, accounting for the confounding effects of correlates of access to road and extension or alternative estimation strategies that address the limitations of the main two-way fixed effect specification. </s>"

Finding_II:The Total Sanitation Campaign led to a significant increase in sanitation ownership among households active in the marriage market
Finding_III:The policy resulted in a redistribution of gains across matched types, with a higher marital match surplus for couples where men are wealthier than women </s><s>Assistant: 
Our estimates provide interesting insights into the determinants of the marital surplus that drive individuals to sort into marriage relative to remaining single. We show that the marital surplus from sanitation increases with the wealth of the household and varies with the wealth of the couple. This suggests that taste and household demand for sanitation vary with the couple’s wealth level. In other words, having sanitation in the marriage is not universally more attractive than an arrangement without. We then use the estimated model to conduct a structural policy evaluation of the TSC to assess whether the policy alters the marital surplus and the division of the surplus.

The evaluation highlights three main findings. First, we document a significant increase in the marital surplus due to TSC exposure. In other words, a decrease in the price of sanitation, a household public good, increases the gains from the marriage that a couple receives relative to singlehood. This increase in marital surplus is consistent with the change in marriage behavior — having sanitation makes it more attractive to be in a marriage for both men and women, inducing some to marry. The increased pool of potential partners leads to changes in sorting patterns. Second, the change in marital sorting results in a redistribution of gains across matched types, namely a higher marital match surplus for couples where men are wealthier than women and a lower marital match surplus for most remaining cases. Third, the policy also reallocated gains within a marriage, where some of the gains in toilet accessibility were redistributed to men, away from women, through the marriage equilibrium process. It is important to note that our results do not imply that the women are necessarily worse off ex-post TSC exposure. The total marital utility is higher, and so in equilibrium, we see more marriages and, thus, the entry of men and women. However, the division of this additional marital utility is not necessarily equal among partners, which is demonstrated by analyzing TSC’s impact on the wife’s surplus share. </s>"

In the medium term, the effect of the monetary reward dissipates relative to the comparison group, while the effect of the public commitment treatment persists.

Finding_III:However, the mental well-being of elderly parents, especially mothers, is negatively impacted by having fewer children. They receive less companionship from children and are more likely to experience depression. </s><s>Assistant: 
Using three waves (2011, 2013, 2015) of the panel data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), our empirical analysis suggests that China’s family planning policies have different effects on parents’ physical and mental well-being. Regarding their physical well-being, we find that parents with a greater exposure to the family planning policies do not reduce household expenditures. Using a wide range of indicators, we find no evidence that parents’ physical health status would deteriorate as a result of longer exposures to LLF. In contrast, the prospect of elderly parents’ mental well-being is not so optimistic, especially for mothers. Parents receive less companion from children as a result of having fewer children. We also find that women more exposed to the family planning policies are more likely to be depressed. Our findings may be related to China’s high elderly suicide rates (ESR), which are found to be four to five times higher than the general Chinese population and more than twice the global average (Li et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2019). Why are the effects of family planning on the elderly’s physical and mental well-being so different? Our theoretical framework offers some rationales to this stylized fact by assuming (1) the mental well-being of the elderly is more sensitive to children’s psychological support than to the financial support, and (2) there exists no technology that can “save” children’s companionship. Whereas parents can save their earned income when they are young to prepare for old age, they can never “save up” children’s companionship. The findings in our study thus call for greater attention to the elderly’s mental health. </s>"

Finding_II:The trade-off between lives and livelihoods varies by income, with poor countries valuing lives relative to income more than rich countries.
Finding_III:Optimal policy in poorer countries becomes more strict due to the recognition that foregoing short-term consumption may be a question of survival for poor households. </s><s>Assistant: 
The model highlights two important points. First, recognizing that foregoing short-term consumption may be a question of survival for poor households has somewhat counter-intuitive implications for policy. Because both infected and susceptible agents, who are pushed close to their subsistence constraint will remain economically active in the face of infection risk and even government containment policies, optimal policy in poorer countries becomes more rather than less strict. Second, comparative statics illustrate that any statement about the desirability of laxer lockdowns in poorer countries is highly sensitive to the VSL and how it changes with income.

Next, we examine how pandemic outcomes and policies varied by income and infection fatality rates (IFR) for 125 countries through the lens of this model. We find, for instance, that, relative to rich countries, poor countries had slightly stricter containment policies during the first year of the pandemic (i.e. before vaccines arrived), but nevertheless experienced smaller drops in economic activity. They also saw higher infections yet fewer deaths. On the other hand, countries with low IFR display laxer containment policies, lower economic contractions, and less excess mortality despite higher infection rates.

We then use indirect inference to estimate the unobserved subsistence constraint and income elasticity of the VSL that produce a close match between data and model in the difference in pandemic outcomes across rich and poor as well as high- and low IFR countries. The model successfully matches the data with an income-elasticity of the VSL which is strictly less than unity – implying the value countries place on lost lives increases less than proportionally with income – and a subsistence constraint that is strictly greater than zero. The value for the income-elasticity of the VSL is in line with estimates in Viscusi and Masterman (2017) who suggest an income-VSL elasticity between 0.8 and 1.2, and lines up with recent cross-country estimates of the incomeelasticity of health expenses (Farag et al., 2012). A positive subsistence level is consistent with a lower elasticity of substitution between labor and consumption at low income levels (see King et al. (1988)) that is commonly found in historical data (Ohanian et al., 2008; Bick et al., 2018; Boppart and Krusell, 2020). </s>"

Finding_II:Exposure to land expropriation increases the probability of having conflicts with local government officials by about 2.5%.
Finding_III:The adverse political impacts of land expropriation are not persistent and can be mitigated by sound local governance and the generation of public benefits. </s><s>Assistant: 
I begin by estimating the overall political impacts. The empirical finding is that if households have directly experienced land expropriation, both political beliefs and political behavior of individuals in these households are affected. Specifically, exposure to land expropriation decreases individuals’ trust towards local government officials by 0.07 standard deviations, which is equal to about 36% of the mean difference in political trust between individuals with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) membership and those without. In addition, exposure to land expropriation increases the probability of having conflicts with local government officials by about 2.5%, compared to a sample mean of 5%, which means it increases the incidence of experiencing conflicts with government officials by around 50%. These adverse effects imply that expropriating land is indeed politically costly for local governments. The results are robust to a variety of internal validity checks.

The empirical analysis also yields three important findings, which further have some important political implications. First, the dynamic estimates show that the effects on both political outcomes are not persistent, instead, they eventually attenuate to zero about four years after treatment. Second, I do not find statistically significant spillover effects, suggesting that the control group of non-expropriated individuals is not affected by the expropriation of the land of their neighbors. Last, individuals subject to expropriation also negatively assess government service and quality, but the effects are significant and remarkable only in the short run. Taken together, these results suggest that the adverse political impacts are not persistent and restrictive to those affected only. In other words, to some extent, land expropriation in rural areas may not pose a fatal threat to China’s political regime.

The Wukan example is by no means the only way in which how land takings occur in China. It epitomizes the worse possible features of land seizures (i.e., low compensation, no ex-ante negotiation, corruption, abuse of enforcement, no public benefits). Arguably, the outcomes could be different if the expropriation does not occur in that way. For instance, one may ask what would be the consequences if the projects are well managed and justified by local governments and/or the land is taken for public use (e.g., expressways and high-speed rail). To this end, I next turn to consider the role of compensation in determining the political effects, and the extent to which the adverse political impacts depend upon governance quality, the public benefits of projects, and the importance of the agricultural land for affected households.

Of course, many factors could intermediate the relationship between land expropriation and political outcomes. I provide four insights into this link. First, I provide evidence that households’ economic wellbeing is not significantly affected by land expropriation, given that (i) land expropriation does not create negative shocks to total household income,8 and (ii) saving asset (bank deposits and cash) of affected households increases, even though it is not persistent. However, compared to the market value of the land, the compensation is very low, indicative of an uneven redistribution of land rents between farmers and local government and property developers, which is likely to be perceived by farmers as unfair. This view is supported by a comparison with urban housing demolition which produces large, positive wealth shocks to affected households and has no impact on political outcomes.9 Second, I find that the adverse political impacts can largely be avoided by sound local governance as reflected by (i) availability of information?about the expropriation projects at the village level, (ii) high government transparency level, and (iii) low government corruption level. Third, the political costs also can be reduced or even eliminated in villages that experience infrastructure improvement (e.g., gaining access to roads and railways or providing electricity or tap water) during the same period when villagers have their land expropriated. Last, the adverse political impacts are less salient for households with at least one member working in the non-agricultural sector before having their land expropriated. In other words, the political costs appear to arise mainly from perceived unfairness of compensation and nontransparent governance and can be reduced when projects generate public benefits or households depend less on agriculture. </s>"

This paper examines the effects of a public policy implemented in Egypt during the 1960s and 1970s to increase access to higher education through the construction of a public university in each province (governorate). To investigate the policy’s impact, we leverage the staggered roll-out of the university construction across the country. We merge data on the time of university construction in the province where individuals attended compulsory school with individual-level data on education, labor, and marriage outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that the establishment of a local university significantly increases the?likelihood of higher education attainment among the exposed cohorts by 2 percentage points, a 12% increase relative to the unexposed. Additionally, we observe that the policy’s impact is more prominent among women, with exposed women displaying a 4 percentage point higher probability of receiving higher education, a 29% increase compared to unexposed women

The construction of a local university has positive longer-term implications for labor market outcomes, benefiting both genders in terms of improved job quality, with a significant increase in the probability of engaging in high-skilled and top-management occupations. However, the policy’s impact was stronger for women. The cohorts exposed to the local university displayed a 3.9 percentage point increase in female labor force participation, a 12.8% increase relative to the unexposed. Additionally, the probability of paid employment among women increased by 3.1 percentage points, representing an 11.7% increase. The policy also impacted marriage outcomes for women, as the exposed cohorts showed a reduction of 0.73 years in the age gap between spouses and a significant increase in the probability of marrying a highly-educated husband, indicating strong assortative mating based on education. Furthermore, affected women were 20% less likely to marry at a young age (before age 18, incl.), exhibited higher levels of intra-household decision-making autonomy, and delayed fertility.

We provide suggestive evidence on the role of migration as a channel for explaining our results. We show that constructing a local university in an individual’s province is associated with a delay in migration age. The share of people migrating before (or at) the age of university enrollment decreased sharply in response to the policy, and the share of those migrating after that age increased significantly. This pattern of migration delay holds true for the two genders, however, it hides variations regarding the reason for migration.

The decline in the before-18 migration for education purposes is more evident among men, suggesting that internal migration for study prevailed as a channel for obtaining higher education among men prior to local university construction. Exposed men were also less likely to migrate for work before age of 18. For women, exposure to local universities reduced the share of migrating for early marriage. This suggests that higher education came as an alternative to early marriage which adds to the improvements in women’s decision-making autonomy and marriage outcomes that we observe in our results. After 18, both genders exposed to local universities are more likely, relative to the unexposed, to migrate for work and marriage. Overall, our results suggest that access to higher education increases mobility and widens the scope for economic opportunities for both genders and the scope for social empowerment among women. </s>"

Finding_II:Firms in more developed regions and regions with better functioning markets and institutions are more likely to change their ownership structure
Finding_III:Firms in industries with a larger innovation gap and greater reliance on labor versus physical capital have more incentives to introduce foreign shareholders </s><s>Assistant: 
We focus on domestic private firms in the analysis. In contrast to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) which possess natural political connections that help them resist competitive pressures, or foreign-controlled firms, which are themselves the major beneficiaries of trade liberalization, domestic private firms are more susceptible to trade-induced competition. Our results are robust to the inclusion of all firms, but the sample with a clearly defined ownership group provides a cleaner estimate of ownership changes than the all-firmsample. Moreover, since China’s opening policy commenced and a few decades of economic reforms have occurred, private firms have become an important component of the national economy. According to the latest statistics based on the annual surveys of industrial firms in China, domestic private firms account for more than 75% of all enterprises and contribute about 60% of China’s employment and output.8 With this representative sample of Chinese firms, we find that the firms more affected by the intensified import competition do not alter their state ownership but relatively increase their foreign ownership compared with the less affected firms. The magnitude of the increaseis considerable. A one-standard-deviation increase in the shock intensity is associated with a relative increase of 0.03 standard deviations in foreign ownership ratio, which accounts for 11% of its sample mean. If we consider firms in the top versus bottom decile of the trade shock, those more shocked by the trade liberalization increase their foreign ownership more than those less shocked by an amount accounting for 24% (7%) of the sample mean (standard deviation).

We explore the heterogeneity of firm responses along theoretically motivated dimensions. First, we examine how firm responses vary between regions with different economic conditions and institutional environments. We find that the baseline patterns of change in foreign ownership are mainly concentrated in more developed regions, as characterized by greater regional gross domestic product (GDP), higher household consumption, and better infrastructure development, and in regions with better functioning markets and institutions, which feature less government intervention, less local protectionism, more mature legal systems, and stronger support for innovation compared with other regions. Second, we explore two potential channels through which foreign shareholders can help firms respondto competitive shocks. First, we find that comparedwith other firms, those in industries with a larger innovation gap relative to the international technology frontiers and?with greater reliance on labor versus physical capital have more incentives to introduce foreign shareholders because they can benefitfrom the adoption of advanced technologies through the participation of foreign investors. Second, we use US industries as the benchmark and compare firms in industries with more versus less dependence on external finance. We find that firms with greater financing needs do indeed have a greater relative increase in foreign shareholders than firms with less dependence on external financing. This result lends support to the financing channel, which suggests that firms sell their equity to foreign investors to circumvent financial constraints. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the strategic role of ownership in strengthening the competitiveness of firms and suggest that product market competition is an important force in ownership dynamics. </s>"

Finding_II:There were no measurable improvements in WASH service provision or increased WASH facility use as a result of the intervention.
Finding_III:The intervention did not lead to changes in school attendance or exam results. </s><s>Assistant: 
We evaluate the impacts of the AWIS intervention on three families of outcomes, eight to twelve months after implementation. First, we evaluate effects on knowledge about WASH and MHM practices among male and female students, male and female teachers, and headteachers, and institutions for WASH service management. For five out of six outcomes, we see small to medium improvements (between 0.1 and 0.3 standard deviations). Not all the individual effects are statistically significant and none independently survive corrections for multiple hypothesis testing that control the family-wise error rate. However, this pattern of consistently positive results is unlikely to have occurred due to chance (p=.031).

Second, we turn to material effects on WASH provision and use. We measure effects on three outcomes: the number of functioning toilets available to students; a toilet quality index, which summarizes measures of functionality, cleanliness, and hygiene; and latrine use. We develop a novel approach to anonymously measuring latrine use, using discreet magnetic door sensors that record when the latrine door is opened or closed. The characteristic signature of a latrine use event in these data is an interval during which the door is closed bookended by two intervals during which the door is open. Door sensors present a potential improvement over other alternatives such as motion sensor cameras, because the entire equipment can be installed outside the cubicle, minimizing intrusion of privacy. We estimate effects on WASH provision and use separately for toilets used by male and female students. We also report the number of functioning toilets available to all students (for which use is not gender-separated), although few schools have them. Three out of seven metrics show statistically insignificant improvements, and four show declines. We thus find no evidence that?the intervention improved WASH service provision or increased WASH facility use.

Most disappointing, the impacts on WASH provision and use are negative for all metrics for toilets available to female students. We did not design our experiment to detect negative effects of the intervention; we prespecified one-sided hypothesis tests to maximize power, given the limited sample size. However, two out of three of these negative effects are statistically significant at the 10 percent level in two-sided hypothesis tests, a pattern of results with a low likelihood of occurring if the intervention had no effect on school WASH services. WASH provision and use for female students decline in treated schools relative to control schools not because WASH service provision worsens in treated schools but because control schools more successfully improve WASH service provision. Future research should investigate whether similar interventions can have negative unforeseen discouragement effects, for example by creating expectations of future external material support that disincentivize independent local action.

Finally, we turn to effects on school attendance and exam results. We do not find that the intervention leads to measurable changes in attendance or achievement in exams. The 90% confidence intervals exclude increases in female student attendance larger than 4.1 percentage points (p.p) or declines larger than 2.9 p.p. and increases in female student exam results of greater than 0.16 points on an 5 point scale or declines larger than 0.12 points. For female students, baseline mean attendance is 66% and the mean exam score is 2.3.5 That the intervention does not measurably affect attendance or results may not be surprising, given the mixed results on knowledge and institutions, and WASH provision and use.

Although the number of schools in the study is relatively small, we maximize our ability to detect effects by collecting rich data at a more granular unit or temporal level wherever feasible. Conversely, we minimize the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions by using randomizationbased inference and reporting conservative multiple hypothesis tests that control the risk of erroneously rejecting any of the null hypotheses within a family of outcomes. Ex post minimum detectable effects using measures of the variance of the estimated coefficients (that are independent of the realized point estimates themselves) suggest that the study was powered (at significance level 10% and power 80%) to detect increases in indexes of between 0.2 and 0.4 standard deviations, typically characterized as small to medium-sized effects (Cohen, 1988). Thus the reason we do not detect effects on WASH service provision is not solely a consequence of power. Adherence to the study protocol was also high, with all schools assigned to treatment successfully treated. </s>"

Finding_III:Female leadership at lower-level Panchayats (village or block level) is the main driver of the reduction in sex selection, but female headship at the district level also reduces sex ratios in urban areas within the district. </s><s>Assistant: 
By investigating child death rates, I test whether the underlying mechanism is that changes in health services disproportionately favored highest birth order girls. I do not find that high birth order girls, amongst children who have survived infancy, have different survival rates during early childhood than girls in general, suggesting that health services remained constant across birth orders. I also test the claim that female leaders directly reduced sex selection fertility services by investigating the impact of female reservations on sex ratios across different socioeconomic statuses. Studies have shown that the use of sex selective abortions is most common amongst more educated women, and less educated women do not appear to rely on abortions as a method of sex selection (Jha et al., 2011, P?rtner, 2016). Thus, restriction of fertility services should more directly impact more educated women. I find that the effects in this paper are strongest for poor and illiterate women, suggesting that the restriction of fertility services likely does not explain the results. Rather, because the least educated women do not rely on abortion as a means to sex select, the reduction in sex ratios documented in this paper is likely driven by increased survival of high birth order girls.

While the main analysis in the paper exploits state-level variation in the timing associated with an increased total level of female leadership within a state, I also investigate if female headship at the district-level Panchayat explains the reduction in high birth order sex ratios in rural areas. I find that the effect is not explained by female headship at the district-level Panchayat, suggesting that female leadership at lower-level Panchayats (the village or the block level) is likely driving the results. Surprisingly, however, I also find that female headship at the district level reduces high birth order sex ratios in the urban population within the district. This is unexpected as the amendment affects local-level government for rural, and not urban, India. I argue that there are reasons to believe that exposure to district-level women leaders is more prominent in urban towns due to the location of district-level offices and media exposure. Consistent with exposure to women leaders being the mechanism, I find that seat reservations for women at the district-level Panchayat decreases the high birth order ratio of boys in areas where exposure to district Panchayat leaders is arguably high, but not in the areas where the Panchayats target their goods and services. </s>"

This finding exemplifies the role local leaders can play in counteracting bad policies implemented by populist leaders at the national level.

One possible concern is that mayors’ characteristics that are relevant for policymaking could be driving our results (Alesina et al., 2019). In particular, the fact that female mayors tend to be more educated in Brazilian municipalities could be an issue (Arvate et al., 2017). We show that, in fact, there is a small and non-robust unbalance in both years of education and ideological preferences between female and male leaders. In order to verify if these characteristics are driving our results, we show that our findings do not change after accounting for them in our regressions. This suggests that the difference we document is likely driven by differences in non-observable traits between female and male leaders. We discuss some possible mechanisms in the results section. </s>"

Finding_II:Male mayors tend to hire more temporary public employees during the electoral year as a way to engage in patronage.
Finding_III:Female mayors receive fewer campaign contributions compared to male mayors, potentially indicating less influence from private interests. </s><s>Assistant: 
In addition, we also analyze reelection outcomes. We find that female mayors are less likely to be reelected compared to their male counterparts. We interpret our findings as showing that, despite being more corrupt, male mayors are more likely to be reelected due to their involvement in patronage and their ability to attract more campaign donations. We provide evidence that is inconsistent with some of the alternative explanations.

The main goal of the paper is to provide novel rigorous evidence about how the gender of the policymaker affects corruption. We rely on an objective measure of irregularities in government contracts and purchases, which comes from administrative data from a federal anti-corruption program in Brazil. Starting in 2003, the federal government began to randomly audit municipalities to detect administrative irregularities in government contracts and purchases. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that links the gender of the policymaker to objective data on irregularities in government contracts and purchases, instead of relying on survey measures as the extant literature. We find that the probability of observing a corruption episode is between 29 and 35% lower in municipalities with female mayors than in those with male mayors.

We also analyze campaign contributions, as political donations are considered to be one of the main ways through which private interests gain influence over elected officials. The main objective of campaign finance regulations is in fact to prevent political corruption (Ansolabehere, 2007, Strauss, 1999).2 Several papers suggest that in Brazil, political campaign financing is a crucial mechanism through which firms establish political connections. Corporations can make cash donations to candidates or party campaign funds, with a maximum of 2% of their previous year's gross revenues, although off-the-books contributions are also quite common.3 Empirical studies have found a significant relation between corporate campaign donations and firm profitability, access to financing, and the probability of receiving government procurement contracts (Bandeira-de Mello and Marcon, 2005, Claessens et al., 2008, Boas et al., 2014). We find that female mayors that run for reelection receive fewer campaign contributions than male mayors running for reelection.4 This may be consistent with our corruption results, to the extent that male mayors may be more likely to manipulate government procurement processes to favor firms that donated to their campaigns.

When analyzing electoral outcomes, we find that female mayors who are eligible to re-run have about 20 percentage points lower probability of being reelected compared to their male counterparts.5 We also find that there is no gender difference in the probability of re-running. Overall, we interpret our findings as showing that, despite being more corrupt, male mayors are more likely to be reelected due to their involvement in patronage and their ability to attract more campaign donations.

Providing conclusive evidence on the link between patronage, campaign donations, and reelection strategies is tricky, because the gender of the policymaker may affect many policies, some of which are potentially unobservable.6 To provide more evidence in line with this interpretation, we consider and rule out alternative explanations. One potential alternative explanation for our reelection finding is that, despite being more corrupt, male mayors may be doing better than female mayors in some policies or may provide more public goods, and this explains their higher reelection probability. However, the great majority of evidence from other countries supports the view that female politicians do a better job than male politicians in providing public goods.7 Whether similar results hold in the Brazilian context is an empirical question

To analyze this alternative mechanism, we study differences across genders in the ability to attract intergovernmental transfers and in the provision of key public goods that depend on the municipal administration: health and education. First, we look at total discretionary transfers for capital investment. In Brazil, the effort of the mayor is one of the main determinants of the amount of these transfers. Second, we analyze health outcomes, focusing in particular on health care services related to prenatal care delivery.8 We focus on prenatal care outcomes because, to the best of our knowledge, these are the only health outcomes readily available at the municipal level and the evidence suggests that they tend to respond quickly to changes in policies (Fujiwara, 2015). Additionally, we focus on educational inputs for which data at the local level are readily available: the fraction of schools in a municipality that have certain facilities (library, science lab, and internet). Our results show that, if anything, women do a better job at attracting transfers and providing public goods. First, we find that female mayors attract about 60% more transfers for capital investment than their male counterparts. Second, our results show that having a female mayor seems to lead to better health outcomes related to prenatal care delivery. Third, female mayors seem more likely to head municipalities with better educational facilities, although the differences are small and statistically insignificant. This suggests that gender differences in the quality and quantity of public goods are unlikely to offer an alternative explanation to why men are more likely to be reelected.
Another potential alternative explanation for our findings is that men and women face different electoral opponents when they run for reelection. This may happen, for instance, if, after a mixed gender close election, the electoral strength of the incumbent is perceived to be gender dependent. For instance, female incumbents may be considered weaker, and thus they may attract more opponents or different opponents. We look at whether the number and education of opponents to female incumbents differ from those of the opponents of male incumbents. Our results are inconsistent with the importance of such a channel.

This result holds in the face of various robustness checks, including using a cross-sectional specification, alternative variable constructions, different matching methods, various sample restrictions, and controlling for city and country-level characteristics. As suggested by our estimates, one additional aid project in a city increases its trade with Russia relative to other countries by 28.9 percent, which translates into 10.5 million dollars in 2002. In addition, we find collaborating evidence that Soviet aid increases the bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) between Russia and China.

We provide a rich set of empirical results to support the affinity mechanism.  Exploiting data from the Pew Global Attitudes Survey, we show that respondents in cities with more Soviet aid have a higher affinity toward Russia, agree more with the view that Russia is an ally of China, and agree less that Russia poses a threat to China.  These differences in opinions persist across generations.  We collaborate with the finding by using food preference as an additional proxy for affinity and show that Soviet aid increases the number of restaurants serving Russian cuisine. </s>"

Finding_III:Women in former British territories of Cameroon face a higher risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) compared to women in former French territories. </s><s>Assistant: We present five sets of results. First, we show that the British colonial rule had a two-sided legacy for women that is still visible today. On the one hand, there remains a persistent impact of the historical Anglo-French border on female participation in the labor market. In particular, women in former British territories have a 24 percentage points higher propensity to be in paid employment than their counterparts in former French territories. In terms of magnitude, this is a large effect considering that the mean female paid employment rate throughout the examined region is 62%. Consistent with the British colonizer effect on female employment, we find that women on the British side of the border are also more empowered in terms of control over household resources and property ownership. On the other hand, we estimate that women on the British side of the historical border face a 10 percentage points higher risk of (past year) spousal violence than their counterparts on the French side. Just as the border effect on female paid employment, this effect is large in magnitude as it compares with a mean prevalence of IPV of 28% throughout the region examined. We demonstrate that the magnitude and precision of these estimates are robust to several alternative specifications.

Second, we ask if the two colonizer effects on female employment and IPV are explained by the same or two different subsamples of women.  The latter is a possibility as the partition of Cameroon and its later reunification induced a multiplicity of treatments: besides its impact on women's economic opportunities, the identity of the colonizer has likely affected many dimensions of life in Cameroon, some of which might be relevant for domestic violence in isolation. We show that the two separate border effects on female employment and IPV are not explained by two separate subsamples of women, with one subsample driving the employment effect and the other driving the IPV effect, but by the same subsample of women.  In order words, those women who, due to the legacy of British colonial rule, are more likely to be employed are also those who experience an increased likelihood of being victims of IPV.

Third, we conduct supplementary analyses to explore some possible explanations for our findings. The result that the British colonial rule caused a persistent increase in both female employment and IPV, and that these two effects are driven by the same subsample of women, is inconsistent with household bargaining models. These models predict that increased economic opportunities for women reduce IPV by leveling the balance of power between partners (Aizer (2010)). By contrast, our results are consistent with theories of male backlash, whereby men resort to violence when their partners’ economic opportunities increase, in order to reinstate a culture of male authority and control over women. Supporting this interpretation, we show that women of the British side of the historical border have a 12 percentage points higher propensity of having a partner who objects to their employment, and that this effect is entirely explained by the subsample of women driving the British colonizer effect on female employment and IPV.

Fourth, while the evidence we provide is suggestive of male backlash (i.e., a causal chain from British colonial rule to higher female employment to increased IPV risk), there might be colonizer effects on third factors driving female employment, domestic violence, or both. Thus, we explore observed individual and household level factors that the literature highlights as such potentially important drivers: male employment, male occupation, male alcohol consumption, education, number of children, age, practice of polygamy, and exposure to conflict. Our RD results show that these factors vary smoothly at the historical Anglo-French border.

Fifth, a potential concern with the interpretation of our results arises if self-reporting of IPV is affected by women's empowerment and, in our setting, by different colonial practices in the past. It could be argued that empowering women changes their attitudes to gender equality and, hence, increases the likelihood of reporting IPV in their daily lives. Agüero and Frisancho (2017) use an experimental approach based on indirect questioning techniques to assess the extent of truthful IPV reporting in the DHS. They find no evidence of IPV misreporting for low-educated women, but highly educated women appear to underreport IPV victimization. This suggests that, if anything, empowered women—i.e., those who do not fit the typical victim stereotype—face larger disutility of being exposed as victims and therefore underreport IPV. Building on this finding, if IPV reporting of empowered women is a threat to our interpretation of the results, we would expect a positive individual level correlation between IPV and different measures of female empowerment other than employment. Multivariate regressions based on our estimation sample show this not to be the case: there is a negative correlation between domestic violence and a woman's education, which is inconsistent with the notion that IPV reporting increases with a woman's empowerment. </s>"
"<s>Human: Write the 'research findings' with the information below:Finding_I:Equal inheritance rights for women in India led to an increase in female foeticide
Finding_II:The reform intensified son preference in fertility, leading to an increase in excess infant mortality among girls
Finding_III:The reform did not significantly change patriarchal norms, as evidenced by no significant impact on co-residence with sons or distance of married daughters' homes from their natal home </s><s>Assistant: We use the three available rounds of nationally representative individual level data from the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) pertaining to births between 1972 and 2004. We find a significant decrease of 3.8–4.3 percentage points in the probability that a girl is born post-reform and post-ultrasound in households where the firstborn child is a girl rather than a boy. This magnitude of decline is outside the biologically normal range.4 In Section 5.1, we put it in perspective, comparing with other studies and with rates of ultrasound scan use.

Our finding that female foeticide increased in response to inheritance reform is robust to the inclusion of state-year of birth fixed effects. These mop up variation in state-level pro-female legislation that may have coincided with inheritance reform, for instance the establishment of Women's Commissions (discussed in Anderson and Genicot, 2015). This is a relevant concern given that India has a federal system and a number of states have, at different times, implemented laws designed to limit the extent of sex-selective abortion (Sekher, 2012). State-year fixed effects also absorb the effects of economic influences on the desire for sons such as the increase in returns to education for girls relative to boys, as well as account for any differential state-level pre-trends in the outcome. Our results are also robust to controlling for mother's age and mother fixed effects, which absorb all mother-specific time-invariant variables including unobservables such as her preference for sons or her fertility preferences (as well as, of course, observables such as her education, caste and religion). The mother's preferences may determine compliance and thus including mother fixed effects will adjust for any changes in the composition of women giving birth post-reform. In addition, our results are also robust to using an alternative dataset (REDS, 2006). Additional robustness checks are discussed in Section 5.2.

The most plausible interpretation of our finding is that in the presence of sticky social norms, awarding inheritance rights to women makes parents more averse to having a daughter rather than a son.5 In line with this, we also find an intensification of stated preferences for sons relative to daughters after the reform of approximately 1 percentage point following the reform, compared to a sample mean of 0.57. Our findings are consistent with the theoretical framework of Botticini and Siow (2003).

In research conducted in parallel with ours, Rosenblum (2015) shows an increase in excess girl mortality (after birth) following the inheritance reform.7 We focus on female foeticide as it is a particularly clean indicator of parental preferences for boys over girls – it involves an explicit decision to conduct prenatal detection of the sex of the child, and this needs to be followed up by the deliberate act of aborting the foetus if it is a girl. However, we also extend our analysis to study impacts of the reform on excess infant mortality among girls, and on son-biased fertility stopping. We find that the reform exacerbates son preference on both these margins.8 In particular, girls born post-reform and post-ultrasound in families with a firstborn girl are 2.3–3.2 percentage points more likely to die before their reaching first birthday (equivalent to 32–42% of the sample mean), relative to boys. Moreover, children in families with firstborn girl are approximately 9 percentage points more likely to have a younger sibling (equivalent to 12% of the sample mean), relative to families with firstborn boy. Together with our sex ratio results, these findings provide compelling evidence in favour of our contention that the inheritance reform intensified son preference in fertility.

A natural question at this point is: if what we capture is a sticky social norm, do we find any corroborating evidence in support of this claim? In order to examine changes in patrilocal norms in response to the reform, we investigate co-residence of parents and adult sons and the distance of married daughters' homes from their natal home using a different dataset: the Rural Economic and Demographic Survey (REDS) 2006. We estimate an increase of 3 percentage points in the probability that a married daughter lives nearer the natal home (up to 10?km away), but this is not statistically significant. We also find no significant impact on the extent of co-residence with sons. Together, these results suggest that patriarchal norms change only very slowly if at all, so that a sharp legislative change intended to favour daughters appears to have raised the perceived cost of daughters enough that parents became more averse to having them. </s>"

Finding_II:Political reservations have improved perceptions of women by men and have increased aspirations for younger women.
Finding_III:Political reservations have led to a significant increase in women's entrepreneurship in India. </s><s>Assistant: Our empirical strategy follows Iyer et al. (2012) by using differences in the timing of the implementation of reservations across Indian states. We conduct a panel analysis at the state-industry level that allows us to exploit this state-level timing variation and differences in traits across industries. Industries are defined at the three-digit level within the manufacturing sector. Empirical results yield a mixed message regarding the extent to which these reforms improved women's participation in the workforce. On one hand, we do not identify that women's employment in manufacturing increased after the implementation of reservations. This limited response is true in both the unorganized and organized sectors, is observed in multiple datasets, and it holds for employment in both female- and male-owned establishments.

On the other hand, we find significant evidence that women's entrepreneurship in India increased with the implementation of political reservations. This increase occurs with a state-level timing that follows the implementation of the reservations, and the growth persists even after controlling for contemporaneous male entrepreneurship by state-industry. We also show that the state-level timing of the implementations was not linked to pre-existing differences in entrepreneurship by state, further adding to the plausible exogeneity introduced by Iyer et al. (2012), and that there is no evidence of pre-trends in the age structures of women-owned manufacturing businesses in 1994. We describe below, however, some important limitations in the degree to which we can fully measure pre-trends, with our evidence often being indirect.

We further investigate the channels through which this entrepreneurship flourishes. The heightened start of women-owned establishments is concentrated in industrial sectors in which women have traditionally owned establishments. Equally as important, the greater entrepreneurship is mostly concentrated in household-based enterprises, rather than establishments opening as independent facilities.

We then discuss the potential channels through which this effect occurs, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence. We do not find much evidence that the entrepreneurship is linked to changes in reporting or to greater access to government-sponsored contracts and business. Likewise, improved financing conditions appear to play a modest role, as the increase in female-owned loan-holding establishments is weaker than the total effect registered and suggests that financing accompanied the increased entry rather than caused it. We then discuss how entry patterns could be consistent with increases at the local level of public goods and infrastructure favored by women (e.g., Besley et al., 2004, Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004a, Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004b, Pande, 2003) or greater aspirations of women towards entrepreneurship (e.g., Beaman et al., 2012). We discuss how these stimuli could have produced the industry patterns observed, to the extent that women entrepreneurs built upon sectors where women have traditionally been active (e.g., Ghani et al., 2013b) and at a household-based scale of operation that was feasible to achieve. </s>"

Most importantly, our results show that the new environmental regulations have led to significantly lower levels of employment in the manufacturing sector in regulated areas: employment in treatment firms fell by 3% relative to similar firms in nonregulated areas, which is similar to the existing findings on the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments (Greenstone, 2002). These results suggest that a 1% reduction in SO2 emissions will lead to a 0.13% decrease in labor demand. Additionally, we find that low-skilled labor and workers in domestic firms are more likely to lose their jobs under environmental regulation in China.Environmental regulations have also increased labor productivity, which may be due to the effects of improved technology.

Spatial inequality is understated by DMSP data, especially in the urban sector. </s><s>Assistant: In the main part of the paper we report on the relationship between night lights and Indonesian GDP at the second sub-national level for 497 spatial units. The DMSP data do not appear to be a suitable proxy for GDP outside of cities, with a negative relationship between DMSP lights and the real GDP of non-urban spatial units, while VIIRS data positively relate to GDP. The negative lights-GDP relationship is especially for rural areas of low population density, in line with the conclusion of Chen and Nordhaus (2011) that luminosity data do not provide reliable estimates of economic activity for low output density regions. A related finding with cross-country data comes from Keola et al. (2015); DMSP night lights negatively relate to GDP if agriculture is a large share of GDP, while there is a positive relationship otherwise. In Indonesia’s urban sector, the lights-GDP relationship is positive irrespective of the type of night lights data used, but the relationship is twice as noisy if the DMSP data are used rather than the VIIRS data. We also find spatial inequality considerably understated by the DMSP data, especially in the urban sector. A Pareto-based adjustment from Bluhm and Krause (2018) to deal with top-coding in DMSP data has a modest effect but the adjusted data still greatly understate spatial inequality, and miss much of the intra-city heterogeneity in brightness (coming from key economic facilities) for Jakarta.

Similar patterns are evident for the other two countries we study. Spatial inequality is understated if the DMSP data are used as a proxy for local economic activity, especially in the urban sector or in higher density regions. Night lights data have higher predictive power for sub-national GDP when working with more aggregated spatial units, such as provinces, while the gap between DMSP and VIIRS in terms of predictive power gets wider for analyses based on smaller or lower level units within the administrative hierarchy. The data for China allow us to compare lights-GDP relationships in the primary sector with those in industrial and services sectors and this comparison shows that night lights data are a poor proxy for primary sector economic activity. Overall, our results suggest that great caution is needed if development economists use night lights data, not only for low density rural areas but also when studying the spatial patterns of urban development. </s>"

Finding_II:Climate change has a more negative impact on agricultural yield than on TFP in China.
Finding_III:Adaptation behaviors in response to climate change have been observed in all three inputs (labor, fertilizer, and machinery) in Chinese agriculture. </s><s>Assistant: We combine the strength of existing literature to investigate the nonlinear relationship between agricultural TFPs and variation in temperature and other weather variables. This article follows two representative approaches introduced by Schlenker and Roberts (2009) in panel regressions: 1) a simple piecewise linear function of temperature and construct the variables of growing degree days (GDDs) below and above a selected threshold and 2) more specific temperature bins that calculate the accumulation of heat for each 3–6?°C temperature interval.The simultaneous variations in additional weather variables, such as rainfall, sunshine duration, humidity, and wind force are also taken into account (Zhang et al., 2017).Panel estimates suggest that piecewise linear function yields results similar to those estimated using more complicated functional forms. An increase in exposure to temperatures above 33?°C results in sharp declines in agricultural TFPs. We use the same methods to evaluate the impact of climate change on yield (measured by unit land output value) and find it to be more negative than the impact on agricultural TFP, as we expected, since extreme hot weather may also lower input utilization in the short run. Applying the same approach, we find evidence that labor and fertilizer usage is indeed significantly reduced with an increase in exposure to high temperature.
To investigate whether longer-term adjustment to climate change has significantly exceeded shorter-run adjustment, we follow Burke and Emerick (2016) to compare the panel estimates with the long differences estimates. Long-run adaptations appear to have mitigated 37.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3%–54.8%) of the short-run impacts of extreme heat exposure on China’s agricultural TFPs. In terms of yield, 46.8% (95% CI, 30.2%–58.0%) of the short-run effect is offset in the long run, which is larger than the offset in TFP, implying the existence of adaptation in input usage. Comparing the panel estimates with the long differences estimates of inputs, we find that adaptation indeed occurred in all three inputs. The negative impact of climate change in labor and fertilizer is smaller, and a positive effect on machinery is found in the long run, indicating that farmers use more machines to replace labor when the weather gets hotter. This finding provides new evidence for the induced innovation theory proposed by Hayami and Ruttan (1971).
Our findings remained remarkably robust when alternative methods to merge climate and agriculture data, alternative temperature bins, alternative productivity measures, and alternative estimation strategies are adopted. Using the estimated coefficients, together with different future climate change scenarios, we further projected the effect of future warming on China’s agriculture. China’s agricultural TFP is projected to decline by 2–6% by 2050 and by 4–12% by 2070 under the global climate models HadGEM2-ES and NorESM1-M. The decline in agricultural yield is projected to be nearly twice as large as the reduction in agricultural TFP in the future. Although climate adaptation is occurring, future global warming is still expected to make a significant negative effect on China’s agricultural production. This effect is likely to increase in the long term, relative to the midterm. This means that the earlier the mitigation actions are taken, the better the policy effects will be. </s>"

Finding_III:Large noncompliant firms upgraded their abatement technology in response to green credit regulations, while small noncompliant firms reduced production due to higher loan costs. </s><s>Assistant: 
We then employ a difference-in-difference strategy to examine the impact of green credit, conditional on the environmental law compliance status of borrowers, on the loan costs and on firms' economic and environmental performance within the context of a prominent increase in enforcement stringency of the Chinese green credit regulation in 2012. Basically, our baseline results reveal that, after 2012, strengthened green credit regulations explain 10.2% of the increase in the floating ratio of the loan rate for firms with noncompliance records relative to their law-abiding counterparts.3 Later, we demonstrate the robustness of our results by conducting several tests to address potential endogeneity issues. Moreover, we study the heterogeneous effects across different types of firms. We find the effects to be more pronounced for privately owned firms (POEs). Additionally, small firms with records of noncompliance with environmental regulations saw a larger increase in the interest rate after 2012. In addition to the above intensive margin effect, we also find out the extensive margin effect, that is, strengthened green credit regulation impedes non-compliant firms’ access to loan.

Finally, we assess the impact of green credit regulations on firms’ operations and emissions. To better explore the underlying mechanism, we consistently take firm size into account. We find that large punished firms experience a relatively smaller decrease in liabilities, compared with small punished firms. Their total assets, fixed assets, investments, and operational performance, including sales and employees, are also less negatively impacted. However, there is no observable difference pertaining to the impact on profits of firm varied by their sizes. When it comes to the environmental performance, although all of these firms reduced their pollution emissions, how the reductions were realized is dissimilar: large firms place a large proportion of their investment into emission control by, for example, adopting more abatement facilities, while small firms simply choose to produce less. Stated differently, upon the green loan regulations, the large noncompliant firms responsively upgrade pollution cleaning technology thus turning green; while small noncompliant firms are forced to produce less due to less loans with higher costs. In a certain sense, financial markets are able to internalize the potential adverse costs of environmental fines on the margins of a borrowing firm. And it would be seen as a sound complementary mechanism to administrations, especially in countries with limited government capacity. </s>"

Finding_III:The net benefit of adopting the new gasoline standard in China is significant, estimated at US$26 billion annually, with health benefits from reduced mortality and morbidity. </s><s>Assistant: 
The analyses yield several main results. First, the enforcement of more stringent fuel standards significantly improved air quality. The average pollution across all pollutants was reduced by 12.9%. The progression from a lower to a higher standard led to an average fall of 9.4 μg/m3 in the concentration of PM2.5. Reassuringly, the long-run policy effect implied by the RD estimate aligns well with that from the DD estimate. Such improvement points to the importance of fuel standards in mitigating vehicles' environmental adversities.

Second, there are some intra-day fluctuations, but these are well explained by the atmospheric chemistry of the pollutants, ensuring the credibility of the main results. Overall, local governments' environmental protection efforts appear to be an important institutional factor in enhancing the environmental benefits of a higher fuel standard, suggesting their importance in China's decentralized system of environmental governance. The new standards are more effective in cities with more active government pollution reduction efforts.

Third, a back-of-the-envelope analysis further suggests that the net benefit of adopting the new gasoline standard is significant, at US$26 billion annually.

"<s>Human: Write the 'research findings' with the information below:Finding_I:A 1 standard deviation fluctuation of rainfall below its long-term mean results in a 7.8 percent increase in dowry deaths and a 4.4 percent increase in domestic violence, controlling for district and year fixed effects.
Finding_II:Dowry payments increase in response to adverse rainfall shocks.
Finding_III:Shocks in agriculturally important periods of rain drive the increase in dowry deaths. </s><s>Assistant: Specifically, we estimate how dowry deaths in individual Indian districts respond to plausibly exogenous local precipitation shocks in a given year. Using the conditional maximum likelihood (also called quasi-maximum likelihood, or QML) estimation method proposed by Hausman et al. (1984) to estimate fixed effects models with count data, we find that a 1 standard deviation fluctuation of rainfall below its long-term mean results in a 7.8 percent increase in dowry deaths and a 4.4 percent increase in domestic violence, controlling for district and year fixed effects. These findings are robust to the inclusion of district-specific time trends and the exclusion of big cities and potential outliers.

We posit that a consumption smoothing mechanism drives these findings, and we present evidence that supports this hypothesis. First, using a dataset collected from a subset of the districts, we show that dowry payments increase in response to adverse rainfall shocks. Second, we show that the incidence of dowry killings in response to shocks is much lower in areas where dowry would be less prevalent due to differences in cultural norms. We also show that shocks in agriculturally important periods of rain drive our results.

An important limitation of our work is that we observe reported crimes, which are the product of two events: occurrence and reporting. Drèze and Khera (2000) point out that murders are very difficult to hide. Furthermore, as described below, Indian law mandates post-mortem examinations in the deaths of young women under a broad set of circumstances, further reducing the likelihood of underreporting. In addition, dowry deaths are reported by the family or friends of the deceased women, who are less likely to be influenced by social norms and fear of retaliation than the women themselves. However, we cannot rule out that reporting is also responding to shocks. If dowry deaths are generally underreported, then our estimates are lower bounds of the true effects. On the other hand, if shocks lead to overreporting—for example, if families report dowry deaths in adverse circumstances to extract compensation for withdrawing the case—then we would see an upward bias in our results. Using aggregate statistics, we show that the percentage of case withdrawals is extremely small and cannot be driving our results. We also show that incidence of dowry deaths is lower in districts where dowry prevalence is likely to be lower. This further suggests that our results cannot be driven by reporting changes alone. </s>"

Finding_II:There was an average decline in fishing intensity of as much as 36 percent immediately following the pollution breakout.
Finding_III:Fishers located downstream of the contaminated zone experienced a more negative impact, with their average income reduced by more than half in 2016. </s><s>Assistant: We estimate the impact of Formosa by employing a series of difference-in-differences estimations (DiD) using individual-worker data, and show that the disaster sharply reduced average fishery income by as much as 42 percent during the rest of 2016. Utilizing high-resolution, satellite-detected data on the prevalence of night-time fishing boats at the monthly interval, we additionally estimate the direct impact of Formosa on fishing activities, showing an average decline in fishing intensity of as much as 36 percent in the period immediately following the pollution breakout. Importantly, we find a large spatial variation in impact's magnitude. Our estimation indicates a more negative impact on fishery communities located downstream of the contaminated zone relative to those upstream and closer to safe waters. In addition, we show that the heterogeneous impact seems to have induced different labor-market coping responses. Satellite data suggests a strong northward movement in the fishing pattern of the affected upstream fishers. Being able to travel to safer fishing grounds allowed these workers to maintain the number of work hours. In contrast, fishers located downstream were more likely trapped inside the contaminated zone; their average income reduced by more than half in 2016. This adverse circumstance led to a significant reduction in fishery work hours and an increase in the likelihood of working secondary jobs. Quantile analysis further suggests a distributional impact across fishery income groups, indicating the strongest damage to fishers in the lowest income quantile.

Next, we study aspects of the disaster recovery by examining Formosa effects on both fishing intensity and fishery earnings over time. We find a gradual reduction in the size of disaster damage to both outcomes. Evidence shows that by the last quarter of 2016, while fishing activity in the affected region had largely recovered, average monthly fishery earnings were still only two-third of the pre-disaster period. Additionally, we examine potential spillover effects of Formosa to other related industries in the affected provinces. Among the industries deemed eligible for Formosa compensation by the government, we find positive earning spillovers to workers in the freshwater-fishery industry, especially those located downstream. Finally, in an extended discussion, we study the potential effect of the government's fishing-ban policy. Evidence from a spatial regression discontinuity design and a triple-differences analysis suggest some, albeit not statistically robust, effect of the ban, which aligns with our view that, rather than being strictly enforced, the ban served more as a mechanism through which the government communicated the severity of the incidence to the public. </s>"

Finding_III:Disaster aid plays an important role in financing the repression mechanism in storm autocracies. </s><s>Assistant: Our empirical analysis corroborates our theoretical prediction that storm shocks cause a deterioration in democratic conditions. First, storms reduce the Polity2 measure of democracy in island countries by 4.25 percent in the following year. In a falsification exercise, we fail to find this adverse effect in an average landlocked or coastal country. Second, we estimate that governments restrict political rights following storms, which constitutes a critical mechanism from storms to a reduced level of democracy. This finding is consistent with the endorsement that the majority of citizens give to populist-autocratic leaders around the world. It also accords with milder forms of repression, such as militarization of the disaster response, given that countries are increasingly deploying their military to extend relief and assistance, at home and abroad (Weeks 2007). We also consider coups and national elections as alternative mechanisms but rule them out. Third, we show that disaster aid is likely to play an important role in financing the repression mechanism. Noting that our benchmark results exclude very large island countries such as Australia and Indonesia, our findings are robust to the use of alternative storm measures, controlling for potential spatial biases and other economic and political control variables as well as the “adaptation” effect to storms, and satisfying the parallel trends assumption. </s>"

Finding_II:African countries that were suitable for the cultivation of maize experienced larger increases in population density and slave exports after the crop was introduced.
Finding_III:The introduction of maize did not lead to economic growth or reduced conflict in Africa, and may have actually increased conflict by increasing slavery. </s><s>Assistant: We find robust evidence in support of both parts of the Crosby-Curtin Hypothesis. Specifically, we find that African countries that were suitable for the cultivation of maize experienced larger increases in both population density and slave exports after the crop was first introduced into Africa. The estimates from our preferred specifications, which include controls for differential trends in European contact and climate, suggest that following the introduction of maize, a 1% increase in maize-suitable land is associated with a 0.025% increase in population density and a 0.024% increase in slave exports.5 These estimates imply that the introduction of maize during the Colombian Exchange played a significant role in shaping precolonial Africa; for the average country, nearly 22% of the population growth over the period 1600–1900, and 6% of the increase in slave exports at the height of the slave trades can be attributed to the introduction of maize.

The third, and final, step in our analysis is to ask whether the introduction of maize had effects on African societies beyond those envisioned by Crosby and Curtin. Our motivation for doing so stems from recent research that has shown that the introduction of New World crops during the Colombian Exchange (particularly, the white potato and sweet potato) increased economic growth (Nunn and Qian, 2011) and reduced conflict (Jia, 2014; Iyigun et al., 2015) in the Old World. In light of the evidence presented by Nunn (2008) and Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) indicating the slave trades negatively affected development in much of Africa, it is possible that the deleterious effects of increased slavery brought about by the introduction of maize may have been at least partially offset by the crop's effects on both growth and conflict. Using the same difference-in-difference strategy described above, we find little evidence that the introduction of maize increased economic growth or reduced conflict in Africa. Indeed, our estimates suggest that if anything, the introduction of maize may have increased conflict by increasing slavery.

Altogether, our estimates suggest that the introduction of maize during the Columbian Exchange played a significant role in shaping Africa's history by affecting population levels, slave exports and conflict. Affected African countries, however, were unable to utilize maize to escape the Malthusian trap. </s>"

Finding_II:The impact of trade policy uncertainty on firm entry is more pronounced in industries with lower entry barriers and larger irreversible investments.
Finding_III:The reduction of trade policy uncertainty is associated with more intensified industry-level competition, and new firm entry accounts for a significant portion of the incumbent productivity change. </s><s>Assistant: In this study, we investigate how the TPU reduction associated with China’s WTO accession has affected new firm entry in China. Using firm registration data from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of China (SAIC), we collect panel data between 1998 and 2006 covering 318 prefecture-level cities and 30 two-digit manufacturing industries in China. Following Pierce and Schott (2016), we exploit the TPU variation across industries before and after China’s WTO accession to conduct a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation. Our results show that TPU reduction significantly promotes new firm entry. Specifically, shifting an industry’s TPU reduction from the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile increases its new firm entry rate by 3.31 percentage points, which is around 16.2% of the average annual manufacturing entry rate in our city-industry sample. //研究内容

We also shed light on the underlying mechanisms of the effect of TPU on new firm entry. First, a firm entry decision is made by comparing the present value of expected profits and the entry cost. When trade-induced uncertainty is reduced and expected future market conditions improve, potential entrepreneurs may find it profitable to start a new business. The extent of TPU’s impact on firm entry depends on the size and sunkness of the entry cost. Using a set of augmented estimations with triple interactions, we show that the marginal effect of TPU on entry is more pronounced in industries with lower entry barriers. Additionally, uncertainty is most relevant when the input is non-recoupable (Dixit et al., 1994, Folta et al., 2006), thus the impact of uncertainty on entry decisions hinges upon the irreversibility of the investment. Consistent with the literature that emphasizes firms’ wait-and-see strategy under uncertainty (Dixit, 1989, Stokey, 2016), we find that the TPU effect on entry is stronger in industries with larger irreversible investments. Second, export expansion and enhanced market access are likely to be key factors, as it is well documented that TPU reduction has been accompanied by exceptional export growth in China (Handley and Limao, 2017, Feng et al., 2017). We therefore seek to understand the extent to which the growth in new firm entry resulted from the exporting vs. non-exporting margins. Using the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) data, we find that the TPU effect is statistically significant for both exporting and non-exporting entrants, and that the magnitude of the former is 2.38 times that of the latter. Our results thus confirm the importance of export opportunity and market size expansion and point to the possible spillover to domestic non-exporting economic activities. Third, we identify the positive role of TPU reduction on regional agglomeration formation, which can further lower the cost of entry and foster new firm creation in the long run. This mechanism can be particularly important for developing economies in the early stage of industrialization. Last, TPU reduction and export opportunities may decrease entrepreneurial activities through an occupational choice mechanism (Díez and Ozdagli, 2020). As productive incumbent firms expand their production and exporting, labor demand and wage rates are likely to increase, which can discourage individuals from pursuing entrepreneurship. Based on the ASIF data, we find that incumbent Chinese manufacturing firms in high TPU reduction industries indeed experience a relative increase in employment size, but no statistically significant difference in wage rates. We discuss how the lack of an occupational trade-off channel may be attributable to the specific labor market conditions in China during the early 2000s. //机制研究

Furthermore, we evaluate the possible regional heterogeneity effects and find that the marginal TPU effect on new firm entry is more pronounced in cities with lower exporting costs or lower entry barriers, illustrating the complementarity between external opportunities and internal reform that has characterized China’s splendid economic performance in the post-WTO era. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that new firm entry plays a non-negligible role in understanding the association between trade and growth. In particular, since the induced entry is primarily attracted by the increase in expected future profits from the US market potentials, we show that the quality of new entrants is relatively higher in industries experiencing larger TPU reduction. Better-performing entrants exert a stronger selection effect by replacing inefficient incumbents and induce a more significant escape-competition effort among incumbents (Asturias et al., 2023, Aghion et al., 2009, Jiang et al., 2021). We report that TPU reduction is associated with more intensified industry-level competition, and that new firm entry can account for around 45% of the TPU-induced incumbent productivity change between 1998 and 2006. //异质性分析 </s>"

First, the adoption of PMC reforms reduces a county's GDP per capita by an average of 3.9%, which translates into a 0.44% drop in the annual growth rate. These findings indicate that in this context a flattened hierarchy is detrimental to economic performance.

Second, both de-jure and de-facto evidence suggests that the PMC reform is mostly a flattening initiative, with the fiscal authority moved from the prefectures to the province. The counties' fiscal revenue and transfers tend to increase after the elimination of the intermediate layer of city government in fiscal management. However, the enlarged span of control for the provincial government has weakened its monitoring and coordination capacity. In particular, total public expenditure and pro-growth investment in PMC counties have declined on average after the reform. More land was sold through negotiation instead of market mechanisms, and at lower prices in the affected counties, pointing to increased land corruption after the PMC reform. This, in turn, may have negatively influenced economic performance. These results demonstrate that such organizational change may well impose costs on the economies concerned that exceed the benefits, and they may also have implications for the design of an effective and productive organization.

Third, using alternative measures of performance, no significant effects on household income or income inequality are evident. Reassuringly, a negative and significant effect on consumption suggests that PMC reform does not in general improve social welfare. </s>"
"<s>Human: Write the 'research findings' with the information below:Finding_I:Access to transportation infrastructure in China does not have a significant impact on the (relative) economic performance of different regions.
Finding_II:The level effect of being close to transportation networks is positive, but not large.
Finding_III:The lack of factor mobility in China may limit the measured impact of better infrastructure. </s><s>Assistant: The results show that being close to the line had a positive level effect. Per capita GDP was higher in places closer to the line. However, the effect is not large. The elasticity of per capita GDP with respect to distance from historical transportation networks is approximately ?0.07. The small level effect is consistent with independent data from a higher-quality household survey for rural areas, the National Fixed Point Survey (NFS) collected by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, which shows that distance has no significant effect on household income. For the estimates of the effect of proximity on growth, we find a precisely estimated zero effect. The estimated elasticity between distance to the line and annual per capita GDP growth is ?0.002 and statistically insignificant (the standard error is 0.003). Places close to the line grew exactly as fast as places further away.

Our finding that better access to transportation networks does not have a large impact on the (relative) economic performance of those areas is consistent with the Fogelian view that transportation infrastructure by itself does not contribute much to growth, excepting perhaps where there was already a demand for it. Based on similar logic, China scholars have criticized the tremendous amount of public investment in domestic transportation infrastructure after 1990 (Huang, 2008).

In assessing what general lessons one can learn from our results, one should consider whether our results are driven by conditions specific to the Chinese context. For example, one may be concerned that the marginal effect of access to infrastructure is especially low in China due to the massive public investment in infrastructure during recent years.3 We believe that this is highly unlikely to be driving our results because our data show large variation in access to infrastructure. The distance to the railroad for the counties that are the nearest the line (defined as the nearest decile) are only one-third of the distance of those furthest (defined as the furthest decile) from the line. Similarly, the nearest counties have more than twice the length of highway relative to the furthest counties (despite the fact that the latter are almost eight times as large). //局限性

Another concern for external validity is that the lack of factor mobility stems from the Chinese government's attempts to control labor mobility and that the empirical findings are not easily generalizable to the context of other developing countries.4 We acknowledge that the Chinese government may be unique in implementing an explicit policy for controlling migration for so long. However, it is important to note that the actual patterns of low levels of migration are not unique to China. In particular, the main policy effort has focused on unskilled low-wage rural workers (Meng, 2005), a group that has been found to be relatively immobile in other contexts such as in India (Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2009). Moreover, our simple theory predicts similar effects regardless of which factor (e.g., labor, capital) is immobile and the immobility of capital has been documented in several developing country contexts. For example, Chan et al. (2011) documents the immobility of capital in China during the period of our study. //局限性 </s>"

Finding_II:For respondents living in areas where FGC was practiced in pre-colonial times, the reduction in likelihood is 6 percentage points.
Finding_III:The number of historical missions in respondents' ancestral ethnic homelands is negatively associated with the likelihood of FGC, with one more mission per 1000 km2 decreasing the likelihood by 8 percentage points. </s><s>Assistant: The empirical results indicate that historical Christian missions did indeed have a long-run impact on FGC practices that persists to this day. The benchmark estimates suggest that a person living 10 km from a historical mission is approximately 4 percentage points less likely to have undergone FGC than someone living 100 km from a mission site. For respondents living in areas where FGC was practiced in pre-colonial times, the equivalent difference is 6 percentage points. The estimated effects are robust to a number of specifications and control variables.

To investigate potential mechanisms, we match our data on FGC and missions with granular geo-spatial data on night lights and on the size of urban agglomerations and use within-survey data on education, religious affiliation and urban residence. Controlling for these possible mechanisms has little impact on estimates. While we cannot provide direct evidence, this is consistent with an impact of missions on norms, which has then persisted. We also investigate the impact of number of missions in respondents' ancestral ethnic homelands. One more historical mission per 1000 km2 in the respondents’ ethnic homeland decreases the likelihood of FGC by on average 8 percentage points. The impact of missions in the ancestral ethnic homeland remains significant when we include missions in the geographic ethnic homeland where they currently live, arguably highlighting the role of intergenerational norm transmission within ethnic groups. </s>"

Finding_II:The positive effect on firm creation was short-lived and disappeared after two years due to increased uncertainty and political events.
Finding_III:Government initiatives such as tax cuts and community-driven development programs helped sustain the economic benefits of the peace agreement. </s><s>Assistant: Our findings are robust to a battery of tests, including the introduction of municipal and department-year fixed effects as well as controlling for differential trends parametrized by various pre-treatment controls. They are also unaffected by selecting the municipal controls with machine learning techniques to maximize their capacity to predict firm creation (Belloni et al., 2014) and their inclusion via inverse probability weighting (Abadie, 2005) or in a doubly-robust way (Sant’Anna and Zhao, 2020). The results are also unchanged to collapsing the pre and post-ceasefire periods to avoid serial correlation (Bertrand et al., 2004), to increasing the overlap between treated and control areas (Crump et al., 2009), to using different definitions of the treatment and the dependent variables, to restricting the control groups to areas affected by other guerilla organization with a similar ideology and tactics, and to performing a permutation test that randomizes the treatments across municipalities to obtain a distribution-free probability that our main result is driven by pure chance.

We also explore the characteristics of the economic dividend brought upon by the creation of new businesses in areas affected by FARC violence. To that end, we investigate the effect of the ceasefire on job creation, the size of the new firms, and their economic sector. Regarding employment, we document that incumbent firms in FARC-affected places do not experience any differential post-ceasefire change in the number of employees, as measured by two independent proxies. In contrast, new firms do differentially increase employment by a magnitude of between 20 and 30 percent. This suggests that the documented excess firm creation was concomitant with employment gains, rather than just triggering jobs reallocation from incumbent to new firms. We also find that the differential business creation takes place across the board, both in low value-added sectors such as agriculture and retail, and in sectors that entail higher value-added, investment and human capital such as manufacturing and tourism. However, most of the new firms created in FARC-affected areas are, at least in the short-run, micro businesses with low capital levels.

We further explore the extent to which key active post-conflict recovery programs implemented since 2017 amplify the economic benefits of the peace agreement. Conflict-affected places that benefited from either tax cuts targeted at the creation of formal employment or community-driven development programs experienced a post-ceasefire surge in firms’ creation that persisted after 2016. This implies that government initiatives have the potential to offset, at least partially, the uncertainty generated by the political turmoil around the implementation of the peace agreement.

Regarding the mechanisms, we provide both quantitative and qualitative evidence suggesting that the short-lived peace dividend was the result of political events that generated economic and political uncertainty. Indeed, Section 2.2 describes how some of the main institutional changes procured by the peace agreement were dismantled or threatened by the Colombian government, especially after the candidate whose main campaign promise was to end the agreement won the presidency in 2018. It also discusses how a faction of FARC sabotaged the agreement by re-taking the arms and returning to illegality, pledging a lack of commitment from the government to implement the agreed policies and institutional changes. Moreover, we document that conflict levels decreased in 2015 and 2016 but rapidly re-escalated since 2017, mimicking our findings regarding entrepreneurial activity. Finally, survey evidence that we analyze in that section suggests that these events negatively affected people’s optimism about the future as well as their perceptions about the improvement of security.4

To study the potential alternative mechanisms that could drive the post-ceasefire dynamics of entrepreneurship, we investigate the extent to which business competition explains the reversion in firm creation in the later post-ceasefire period. To this end, we look at temporal patterns of firm exit and find no evidence supporting this channel. We also explore whether pent-up demand in FARC-affected areas could explain the short-lasting economic recovery and we find weak evidence of this. As a third alternative, we test the hypothesis that all the observed firm entry is driven by the formalization of pre-existing businesses. We conclude this is unlikely the case. Finally, we look at the possibility that internal migration may explain our results and reject this idea. </s>"

Finding_III:Girls are catching up to boys in intergenerational mobility in both developing and high-income countries. </s><s>Assistant: We obtain the following empirical findings. First, for the youngest cohort born between 1980 and 1989, intergenerational mobility is lower in the average developing country when compared to the average high-income country. This observation holds true for all six measures of mobility. Second, we observe a convergence in mobility when using measures that are sensitive to changes in education inequality across generations (inequality-sensitive measures), but a divergence in mobility when using measures that are invariant to changes in inequality (inequality-invariant measures) are used.

Third, regarding the relationship between intergenerational mobility and national income, we similarly observe two distinct patterns. Inequality-sensitive measures of mobility show a monotonically increasing relationship, while inequality-invariant measures show a U-shape-pattern with high levels of mobility observed among the richest as well as the poorest countries (arguably for different reasons).4 Fourth, Sub-Saharan Africa stands out as a region where children have been least successful at surpassing their parents' education, despite the comparatively low levels of parental education. In the poorest countries, the scope for surpassing parents is greatest but the capacity to educate children is lowest. By contrast, in the world's richest countries, the capacity to educate children is greatest but the scope to surpass parents is lowest. In other words, for two individuals with the same parental education background, it greatly matters what country one is born into, which sits well with Milanovic (2015).

Fifth, the world as a whole is notably less mobile than the average country in it. This underscores the importance of the country in which one obtains his/her education. We furthermore observe a modest upward trend in global mobility measured by inequality-sensitive indicators, while global mobility measured by inequality-invariant indicators is more stagnant. This empirical pattern is consistent with a decline in global inequality over time (Lakner and Milanovic, 2016). Sixth, when intergenerational mobility is disaggregated by gender, girls are found to be catching up to boys in the average developing country. Girls have already overtaken boys in the average high-income country for selected measures of intergenerational mobility and if current time-trends prevail, girls are on track for also surpassing boys in the developing world in the coming decade(s). </s>"

Finding_II:Moving from an area without TV to an area with TV lowered participation by 4 percentage points in pro-opposition polling centers in the repeat election.
Finding_III:Exposure to TV had no significant effect on the occurrence of protests between the two elections. </s><s>Assistant: First, I find no evidence that exposure to the signal changed voters’ likelihood of turning out in the first election — i.e. in normal times. However, it had a sizable impact on the repeat election. Based on the stark political divides across the territory, which largely interact with ethnic belongings (Horowitz and Long, 2016), I split the sample between polling centers that voted in favor of the opposition or the incumbent President in 2013. Strikingly, the sign of the estimates is opposite in the two political camps. In pro-opposition polling centers, moving from an area without TV to an area with TV lowers participation by 4 percentage points. Conversely, I find that TV has a positive and large effect on remobilization, ＋7 percentage points, among supporters of the incumbent and final winner of the election. Moreover, as the incumbent’s win margin in the previous poll increases, the effect of signal reception grows larger. The estimates suggest that a 10-percent increase in the incumbent’s score adds 1.5 percentage points to the baseline coefficient.

Turning to the possible impact of exposure to TV on involvement in the electoral protests, I find that it has no effect on average, but tend to decrease slightly the probability of conflict in the surroundings of pro-incumbent’s polling centers. Yet, I find no effect at the intensive margin, that this to say on the number of demonstrations.

These findings are corroborated with a series of robustness checks. The results are similar when the sample is restricted to areas that got access to the signal after 2016, which suggests that they are not driven by more urbanized places. This also indicates that the treatment effect is not contaminated by the larger penetration of the Internet and social media in bigger cities – in rural areas in 2016, 77% of the population never get access to news through the Internet (Afrobarometer) –, nor by the higher likelihood to be directly exposed to urban riots.2 Moreover, a placebo test confirms that the results are not spurious as I find no effect of being granted access to the signal in 2018, i.e. just after the 2017 election on mobilization.

In the last part of the paper, I delve into the potential channels of transmission and investigate various mechanisms that could account for the difference between the August and October elections, as well as the opposite effects in the two political camps. I argue that television played a predominantly informative role leading up to the repeat election. Given the unexpected decision by the Supreme Court and the exceptional circumstances surrounding it, voters required clear and comprehensive information to grasp the unfolding events and the need for a subsequent vote. Employing text analysis tools, I examine the content of news bulletins from the five most popular Kenyan channels and provide an overview of the TV coverage in 2017 and at the time of the repeat election. The analysis reveals a notable emphasis on the election, especially in the vocabulary employed, as well as a decline in the diversity of news topics covered, suggesting a significant focus on the prevailing context. Additionally, I document that the content heavily focused on protests and the climate of crisis. By comparing the impact of television exposure alongside physical proximity to the protests, I find no exacerbating effect of being in close proximity to demonstrations. Furthermore, exposure to protests without television does not significantly influence turnout, implying that the effect of television was primarily to disseminate information regarding the scheduling of the repeat election.

Furthermore, I explore the potential variations in editorial choices among different channels. This undertaking poses challenges due to the lack of reliable data on audience and viewership in Kenya. Computing the cosine similarity index between pairs of TV centers, I find that channels exhibited distinct editorial stances in 2016, i.e. prior to the start of the electoral season. However, in 2017, the cosine similarity matrix suggests a convergence among the channels, thereby reinforcing the notion of increased emphasis on the election. However, the state-owned station KBC TV stands out as the most distinct channel compared to others, and this distinctiveness appears to be even more pronounced in the four weeks preceding the repeat election. Based on the assumption that pro-government voters may be more inclined to watch this channel, it is plausible that they have been exposed to the incumbent’s call for remobilization and have shown their trust in their leader through this channel.

Last, TV’s collective dimension in Kenya may help explain the observed effect of media exposure. Limited ownership of TV sets leads people to rely on public places like cafes and restaurants to watch news broadcasts. This assumption suggests that TV viewing is a social experience, which could contribute to the consolidation of social coordination mechanisms.

Finding_II:Male general upper-secondary education graduates do not earn higher wages than vocational education graduates.
Finding_III:Among employed male upper-secondary education graduates, general graduates are not more likely to have a public sector job, but they are more likely to have formal jobs in the private sector. </s><s>Assistant: The results suggest that male upper-secondary general education graduates aged 25–49 experience no advantage in terms of employment probability compared to vocational education graduates. Often, young men in developing countries cannot afford not to work (Fields, 2004), which also holds true in our sample, where approximately 90% of the observed men are employed independent of their highest education degree.7 However, a high level of employment alone is no guarantee of being able to make a living from it. Especially in countries with a large informal sector, such as Egypt, it is also important to account for the quality of employment.8 We do so using wages for those in wage employment. Wages are a central measure of employment quality contributing directly to workers’ material well-being (Cazes et al., 2015). In addition, we account for employment quality by using two measures for formal employment, namely, public sector and formal private sector employment, which are often associated with good working conditions and wages (Assaad, 1997, Krafft and Assaad, 2015, World Bank, 2014). We find that, conditional on wage employment, male general upper-secondary education graduates do not earn higher wages than vocational education graduates. This result likely reflects the low power of the first stage in the sample of male wage-earning upper-secondary graduates. Regarding job formality, we show that among employed male upper-secondary education graduates, general graduates are not more likely to have a public sector job. In contrast, conditional on private sector employment, male upper-secondary general education graduates are more likely to have formal jobs. Given this finding, it is surprising that our results do not suggest higher wages for general upper-secondary graduates, as formal private-sector jobs in developing countries are often associated with high productivity levels and high wages (Günther and Launov, 2012, La Porta and Shleifer, 2008). However, crony capitalism may limit the productivity of formal private-sector jobs in Egypt (Chekir and Diwan, 2014). Moreover, formal private sector jobs offer job security, and benefits such paid sick leave (World Bank, 2014).9 An analysis by age shows no statistically significant differences in the short or long term for any of the four outcomes, which is in contrast to the results of other studies in this area. (e.g. Hanushek et al., 2017, Brunello and Rocco, 2017). We confirm these findings through several robustness checks. Our findings on employment and wages are in line with some studies that demonstrate a neutral long-term effect, while our finding of a relative advantage of general education in terms of job quality contradicts the rest of the literature, where employment quality is often measured in terms of wages. The reasons for this difference could be the relatively low quality of vocational education in Egypt, low permeability of Egypt’s education system (Assaad, 2010, Krafft, 2018), or lack of work-based training. Involving the business sector could improve the labor market outcomes of vocational upper-secondary graduates (Bolli et al., 2021). </s>"

Finding_II:Farmer perceptions of soil similarity play an important role in individual contributions, with farmers contributing about 10% more when they perceive the sampled plot's soil type to be similar to their own.
Finding_III:Cooperative behavior within soil-type groups exists, but decreases as the group size increases, indicating the presence of free riding in larger soil-type groups. </s><s>Assistant: Our data and experimental results allow us to draw four conclusions.

First, we find that farmers contribute a considerable amount towards the soil test. Average individual contributions are 45% of the endowment, around 900 MK, implying an average total village contribution of 18,000 MK per round, significantly exceeding the 7000 MK cost of the soil test.

Second, farmer perceptions of soil similarity play an important role in these individual contributions. Exploiting within-farmer variation across rounds, we find that farmers contribute about 10% more when they perceive the sampled plot’s soil type to be similar to their own. This implies that farmers recognize that the management recommendations from the soil test are soil-type specific. For example, recommendations for a sandy soil will be of less use to a farmer with a loamy soil. We find comparable results when using alternative measures of similarity, such as distance between plots. The individual-level results suggest that social learning might be limited if soil heterogeneity increases.

Third, using an analysis at the soil-type level, we find that farmers exhibit cooperative behavior within their soil-type group, but that the degree of this cooperation depends on the size of the group. As the group size increases by five (the median group size), average individual contributions drop by 7% and the coefficient of variation of contributions within the group increases by 41%. In the context of this discrete (public) good, i.e. our soil test, this indicates that free riding plays a role in larger soil-type groups.5

Fourth, we find a positive correlation between village-level soil heterogeneity and average contributions. Villages with more soil types have higher individual contributions, on average. This result is relevant to extension workers, who might want to use local soil maps to proxy ex ante farmers’ willingness to invest in a village soil test. However, the correlation is no longer statistically significant when we add a wide range of village-level controls including market access and average demographic characteristics. This full suite of village attributes may not be available to extension workers; our results suggest that soil heterogeneity is correlated with these and possibly other unobservable characteristics in the village. </s>"

In line with expectations, we do not observe this effect in weeks when medical bills are covered by health insurance. Moreover, households sell a relatively larger share of milk in the spot market in weeks when households have less cash on hand, following periods of low levels of milk production and non-dairy income. These findings suggest that households sell in the market in order to satisfy urgent cash needs, while opting for less flexible (but higher-return) savings when in a more comfortable financial position. Interlinking cooperative membership with health insurance reduces the incentives to side-sell, but does not shield households from other liquidity constraints. Additional integration of the agricultural contract with financial services such as cash advances and credit may be necessary to further enhance the financial sustainability of cooperatives. </s>"

Finding_II:Tips make consumers more cautious, leading to a higher likelihood of classifying any given message as a scam.
Finding_III:Tips are effective in increasing scam identification ability only for more experienced DFS users and those with higher education. </s><s>Assistant: We find that on average tips do not increase scam identification ability. This null effect arises because while respondents in the treatment group are more likely to correctly identify scams, they are also less likely to correctly identify genuine messages. On average, tips appear to make consumers more cautious, i.e., more likely to classify any given message as scam. Moreover, receiving tips makes respondents significantly more confident in their classification decisions. The increase in confidence could be concerning as average SIA does not increase in our study and overconfidence has been found to be correlated with victimization (McAlvanah et al., 2015). However, we find suggestive evidence that higher confidence is associated with better SIA at the individual level.

Looking deeper, we find a more nuanced result depending on whether a given message contains a “scam marker”. First, tips increase the number of correctly identified scams, irrespective of whether a scam marker is present in the message. This suggests that tips indeed make people more cautious. Second, a scam marker in a genuine message increases the likelihood of this message being classified as a scam. Part of the null effect of tips thus seems to be driven by official messages that look like scams. This highlights that tips need to be specific enough to unambiguously increase SIA and that non-scam communication should avoid features that are commonly cautioned against in educational campaigns.

To test whether the results change when money is at stake, a random half of our sample receives incentives for each correct classification. Results show that incentives do not lead to better SIA, and there is no interaction effect with tips. While we find some indications that those who receive both tips and incentives exert more effort, these individuals are not performing better. This implies that our measure can be used as an unincentivized survey measure. We also investigate treatment effect heterogeneity and illustrate an important shortcoming of such education interventions. Tips appear to be effective in increasing SIA only for more experienced DFS users and those with higher education. Less educated participants do not benefit from tips, suggesting that it is difficult to design universally-helpful communication.

Finding_II:The increase in the stock of robots also resulted in a decrease in average wages in local labor markets by 0.77%.
Finding_III:The negative effects of robots on employment and wages were most pronounced in manufacturing industries and routine manual, blue-collar, assembly, and related occupations. </s><s>Assistant: Using this strategy, we estimate a negative relationship between a commuting zone’s exposure to robots and its post-1990 labor market outcomes. Our estimates imply that between 1990 and 2007 the increase in the stock of robots (approximately one additional robot per thousand workers from 1993 to 2007) reduced the average employment-to-population ratio in a commuting zone by 0.39 percentage points and average wages by 0.77% (relative to a commuting zone with no exposure to robots). These estimates are sizable but not implausible. For example, they imply that one more robot in a commuting zone reduces employment by about six workers; this estimate includes both direct and indirect effects, the latter caused by the decline in the demand for nontradables as a result of reduced employment and wages in the local economy. To understand the aggregate implications of these estimates, we need to make additional assumptions about how different commuting zones interact. Greater use of robots in a commuting zone generates benefits for the rest of the US economy by reducing the prices of tradable goods produced using robots and by creating shared capital income gains. Our model enables us to quantify these positive spillovers across commuting zones and leads to smaller but still negative aggregate effects. With our preferred specification, our estimates imply that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the aggregate employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percentage points and wages by about 0.42% (compared with its larger local effects, 0.39 percentage points and 0.77%, respectively), or equivalently, one new robot reduces employment by about 3.3 workers. We verify that our measure of exposure to robots is unrelated to past trends in employment and wages from 1970 to 1990, a period that preceded the onset of rapid advances in robotics technology. Several robustness checks further bolster our interpretation. First, our results are robust to including differential trends by various baseline characteristics, linear commuting zone trends, and controls for other changes affecting demand or productivity in various industries. Second, we show that the automotive industry, which is the most robot-intensive sector, is not driving our results. Third, consistent with our theoretical emphasis that robots (and more generally, automation technologies) have very different labor market effects than other types of machinery and overall capital deepening, we find no negative employment and wage effects from capital, other IT technologies, or overall productivity increases. The employment effects of robots are most pronounced in manufacturing and particularly in industries most exposed to robots. They are also concentrated in routine manual, blue-collar, assembly, and related occupations. Consistent with the presence of spillovers on nontradables, we estimate negative effects on construction and retail as well as personal services. </s>"

Given (ln) mean establishment earnings (MEE), industry, and occupation (in 2000), the gender earnings gap increases less: by 18.9 log points. Thus, 44 percent of the gap widening for college graduates is due to differential mobility between establishments by gender and 56 percent is due to differential earnings changes within establishments by gender (see also Barth, Kerr, and Olivetti 2017). For those who graduated high school but not college, the gap grows from ages 23 to 36 (1995–2008) by 15.6 log points but expands by just 8.1 log points given MEE (plus industry and occupation).

Finding_II:Increased availability of broadband internet is associated with a substantial increase in the output elasticity of skilled labor and a decrease in the output elasticity of unskilled labor.
Finding_III:Broadband adoption in firms is a skill-biased technological change, increasing the marginal productivity of skilled workers and lowering the marginal productivity of unskilled workers. </s><s>Assistant: We begin by estimating the intention-to-treat effects of the increased availability of broadband internet on the labor market outcomes and productivity of different types of workers. We find two pieces of evidence that suggest skill complementarity of broadband internet. On the worker side, we find that wages and employment of (un)skilled individuals increase (decrease) with broadband availability. On the firm side, we find that increased availability of broadband internet is associated with a substantial increase (decrease) in the output elasticity of (un)skilled labor. A comparison of the changes in output elasticities and worker outcomes suggest that firms earn substantial rent from increased availability of broadband internet, at least in the short run. After performing a battery of specification checks of the intention-to-treat effects, we explore several possible channels through which increased availability of broadband internet may affect worker outcomes and productivity. We find evidence against the hypothesis that our findings reflect changes in the demand for goods due to the expansion of broadband internet. Our data are also at odds with broadband adoption coinciding with general technical upgrading in firms. Another possible mechanism receiving little support in data is that our findings are driven by changes in labor productivity and wages in firms directly affected by the expansion of broadband access, such as telecom firms or IT consultancy companies. Instead, we find suggestive evidence that increased availability of broadband internet affects worker outcomes and productivity primarily through broadband adoption in firms. If that is the case, the plausibly exogenous variation in broadband availability may serve as an instrument for broadband adoption in firms. This allows us to estimate production functions where firms can change their technology by adopting broadband internet. We find that broadband adoption in firms is a skill-biased technological change, shifting how factor inputs are transformed into output. In particular, this technological change increases the marginal productivity of skilled workers, and lowers the marginal productivity of unskilled workers. To better understand the skill complementarity of broadband internet, we pursue a task-based approach to skill-biased technological change. Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) argue that ICT substitutes for workers in performing routine tasks—more amenable to automatization—and complements workers in executing problem solving, complex communication, and informationintensive tasks (often called ‘‘nonroutine abstract tasks’’).3 A necessary condition for a task-based explanation of the skill complementarity of broadband internet is that workers of different educational background actually cluster disproportionately in occupations that require different tasks. In our data, we find that skilled workers are overrepresented in occupations that are pervasive at nonroutine abstract tasks, whereas unskilled workers are often in occupations that involve routine tasks. Motivated by these differences, we estimate wage regressions which include interactions between broadband internet and the tasks performed in jobs in addition to the educational credentials of workers performing those jobs. The estimates suggest an important channel behind the skill bias of broadband internet is that it complements nonroutine abstract tasks but substitutes for routine tasks. </s>"

Finding_II:The unexplained gender wage gap has remained persistent at around 25-30% for most of the time span, only declining in recent years.
Finding_III:Factors such as wage inequality, minimum wages, and gender attitudes have helped narrow the gender wage gap in Estonia. </s><s>Assistant: The paper demonstrates that the raw gender wage gap for full-time workers was as large as 41% in 1989 during communist times. The raw gender wage gap diminished quickly after the market economy was introduced, mainly because characteristics of the wage structure under communist rule such as low returns to education were eroded. The gap closed much more slowly afterwards. The unexplained gender wage gap has been highly persistent at around 25–30% for most of the time span, and only declined in recent years. Women have definitely won from the transition from the communist economy to a market one, as their education is rewarded more highly by the labour market and they have much better education than men nowadays. Women have gained access to better jobs as the role of occupational segregation in explaining the gender wage gap has diminished. The only factor that has a similar effect in enlarging the gender wage gap in 1989 and 2020 is sectoral segregation, as there are still many more women employed in low wage sectors such as education and services. These trends have also been observed in other developed countries that do not have a communist past.

We show that despite the rapid and liberal economic reforms and the successful economic convergence, the gender wage gap has been resistant to decline. Estonia had the largest gender wage gap among communist countries in 1989 (Brainerd, 2000a, Brainerd, 2000b, Orazem and Vodopivec, 2000) and the largest gender wage gap in the EU in 2018 (Eutostat series TESEM180). None of the long-run cultural factors that have been found to shape gender attitudes can explain the wide gap. However, we demonstrate that country-level factors such as wage inequality, minimum wages and gender attitudes have helped narrow the gap. The strongest effect comes from wage inequality, and the decline in wage inequality can explain 6.5pp of the 15pp reduction in the unexplained gap. The gradual increase in minimum wages accounts for more than half of this effect. More egalitarian gender attitudes have also contributed to the closing of the gender wage gap, although this effect is probably responsible for a smaller part of the change compared to wage inequality. </s>"

For the gap at the 25th percentile, the effect still amounted to 18%, while for the mean it was smaller (11%) and not particularly robust. Using a continuous bite measure, we can show that an increase in a region’s bite by ten percentage points, reduces the wage at the 10th percentile by 3.3 percentage points. This thus shows that the minimum wage reform led to a significant decrease in the wage gap especially at the bottom of the wage distribution. </s>"

Finding_II:Women are less pre-disposed to negotiate and more risk-averse compared to men.
Finding_III:Gender differences in propensity to negotiate and risk preferences account for nearly one sixth of the unexplained component of the gender wage gap. </s><s>Assistant: Our results are as follows. First, analysis using the 2014 wave of the VHLSS data shows that the gender wage gap is negative, and statistically significant. There is substantial variation across and within sectors. We also find that the explained component of the gender wage gap is negative. This implies that women should earn more than men based purely on observable characteristics. The extent of the gender wage gap is the highest in the manufacturing sector. Second, using our experimental data, we show that women on average are () less pre-disposed to negotiate and () more risk-averse. Gender difference in the propensity to negotiate is, however, context-dependent. Men and women are equally likely to negotiate when wage offers are unfair. However, when wage offers are fair, men are 50% more likely to negotiate than women.5 Third, in our sample, we find women earn 6.4% less then men. Our subsequent decomposition analysis shows that the unexplained component of the gender wage gap is about 127% of the total gap. These results (which are consistent with those obtained using the nationally representative VHLSS data) imply that if workers were paid purely on the basis of their endowment, women would be earning more than men, i.e., the gender wage gap would be reversed. Fourth, including the propensity to negotiate in the set of explanatory variables is associated with a 13% reduction in the gender gap in earnings (the coefficient estimate of the female dummy increases from 0.067 to 0.060); similarly, including risk preferences is associated with a 14.5% decline of the earnings gap. Controlling for both is associated with a 29% reduction in the gender wage gap (the female dummy increases from 0.067 to 0.049). These results are consistent with the findings of our decomposition analysis, which shows that gender differences in propensity to negotiate and risk preferences together account for nearly one sixth (15.5%) of the unexplained component of the gender wage gap. Our results are in the same ballpark as previous studies in terms of comparability of the magnitude of effects. For example, gender differences in preferences towards entering competition account for about 20% of the difference in career choice between men and women (Buser et al., 2014), 7–10% of the gender wage gap among university students post-graduation (Reuben, Sapienza, Zingales, 2019, Kamas, Preston, 2018) and 18% of the gender gap in expectations about future earnings (Reuben et al., 2017). </s>"

Finding_II:Mobile Internet coverage led to a larger number of parties running for elections.
Finding_III:The popularity of the incumbent party decreased as a result of mobile Internet. </s><s>Assistant: I find that mobile Internet in fact increased people’s political participation in South Africa, and it did so immediately after its arrival.1 I also find a positive effect on political competition, reflected in a larger number of parties running for elections. In turn, after more than two decades, the undisputed dominance of the incumbent party was damaged. Altogether, these results suggest that mobile Internet has the potential to improve the quality of the democratic process in developing countries.
In the most conservative specification, my findings show that a unitary increase in 3G coverage (i.e. from 0 to 100% of area covered) led to a 2-percentage-point increment in voter turnout (approximately 4% of its value in 2006) in 2011 and 2016. At the same time, mobile Internet was detrimental for the popularity of the incumbent party, whose vote share dropped by more than 3 percentage points in 2016 as a consequence of mobile Internet. By contrast, other parties gained. Moreover, as a result of 3G, competition at ballots intensified: the number of parties running for elections in more covered localities went up by 10% compared to 2006. Lastly, the number of protests against political institutions roughly tripled in 2016, suggesting that mobile Internet arrival exacerbated political discontent or facilitated mass mobilization. The results are robust to different specifications, estimators and units of observations. Various placebo exercises support the validity of the identifying assumptions.
I complement these findings with suggestive evidence on the possible mechanisms. Following Campante et al. (2018) and Manacorda and Tesei (2020), I investigate the information and coordination potential of mobile Internet for local politics.3 For voters, access to mobile Internet can significantly decrease the cost of obtaining information and, eventually, affect their voting behavior. In line with this hypothesis, I find a more detrimental impact of 3G coverage on the performance of the incumbent party in municipalities with worse administration of government finances and in localities more exposed to socio-economic turmoil. At the same time, for (potential) candidates, digital technologies could drastically reduce communication and coordination costs with voters, thus making barriers to entry into politics easier to overcome, especially for smaller groups that lack significant financial resources. In this respect, I find that mobile Internet coverage facilitated political turnover and fostered political competition by favoring the emergence of new parties. Overall, these findings suggest that the arrival of 3G technology in developing countries can provide a new source of information for voters and a cheaper mass mobilization tool for candidates. </s>"

Finding_III:The impact of the digital platform varied across geographic zones in India, with the strongest reversal in employment rates observed among priority treatment graduates in the South West and East regions. </s><s>Assistant: We find a strong, but unexpected response to being enrolled on the platform: new graduates are 9 percentage points less likely to be working 12 months after being notified they would have access to Job Shikari. We also show that a steady stream of information for the priority treatment group results in these graduates “catching up” to the control group. Priority treatment graduates are only 4 percentage points less likely to be employed than control. This reversal in employment rates relative to the treatment group is statistically significant. These effects appear to be driven, at least in part, by changes in individuals’ beliefs about what the platform can do for them: we see that reservation wages increase for the treatment group, and fall for priority treatment.

We also find that some youth “catch up” more quickly than others. We look at differences across four geographic zones in India (North, Delhi, South West, and East). We find that the reversal in employment rates is strongest among priority treatment graduates located in the South West and East. This sample was older, from lower castes and more likely to be married relative to our sample in the North or Delhi — features that may have increased the opportunity cost of holding out for a job on Job Shikari. They were also spatially mismatched relative to jobs advertised by the platform, which were largely in Delhi. While these positive priority treatment effects we observe for youth in the South West could be generated by new matches, several patterns in the data suggest that this group learned the platform was delivering jobs they were unwilling to migrate for, which prompted them to accept outside offers more quickly rather than hold out for better opportunities on Job Shikari.

These results provide clear evidence of voluntary unemployment among the young adults in our sample, as predicted by seminal models of job search (McCall, 1970, Jovanovic, 1979): perceptions of access to new sources of job opportunities should boost reservation wages, and reduce employment in the short run. These effects may be larger and more persistent if youth have inaccurate expectations about the effectiveness of the platform, and if job opportunities fail to materialize. Nevertheless, as these recent graduates receive additional information about job opportunities they should update their perceptions of the new arrival rate of jobs and adjust their beliefs about their employment prospects. These predictions are borne out in our data: youth are overly optimistic about their wage prospects at baseline, and when they are notified that they will be registered with a digital platform they increase their reservation wages, and reduce employment for at least 1 year. However, when we increase the amount of information that job seekers in our sample receive about jobs, it appears that a subset may have been able to overcome their biased beliefs. This is consistent with work by Bandiera et al. (2023) who show that job seekers revise their beliefs downwards in response to negative signals about their labor market prospects (when call back rates from employers are lower than they anticipated).

These results also suggest that the impact of digital platforms depends crucially on individuals’ expectations of what these platforms can deliver. If platforms generate high expectations but the job offers are weak, we can expect to see some amount of voluntary unemployment as individuals hold out for better jobs. The magnitude, and stickiness, of this effect will depend on the extent to which individuals update their beliefs about the likelihood of finding a job. For several reasons, the digital platform we study may have been particularly well-suited to identifying this effect: job offers on the platform were relatively undesirable, and our sample of young, recent graduates may have been particularly susceptible to changing beliefs (and may have entered the study holding beliefs that were already biased by promotional statements from the training institutes they graduated from (Alfonsi et al., 2023, Banerjee and Chiplunkar, 2023). At the same time, we anticipate that this set of conditions may not be unusual. Youth are frequently the target of job matching interventions, particularly those that take place online. Moreover, private sector digital platforms may frequently have access to relatively undesirable opportunities: platforms commonly charge firms to make connections to job seekers, which is most valuable when matches are hard to find. For unskilled jobs, matches will be scarce when wages are low or working conditions are unappealing. If young graduates do not learn that platform jobs are negatively selected, they may stay unemployed for longer durations, as is the case in our study. This highlights the importance of educating youth about what they can expect from these new labor market interventions well ahead of time. </s>"

Second, we find that the intervention had an overall negative impact on caregivers’ mental health. Contrary to what we had hypothesized in our pre-analysis plan, our estimations indicate that the mental health of treated caregivers worsened by 0.057 standard deviations (SD) relative to the caregivers in the control group. This effect was driven by a 0.072 SD increase in stress. Third, despite the negative impact on mental health, we find no evidence that the intervention changed caregiver impulsiveness, the quantity of caregiver–child interactions, caregiver perpetration of abuse and attitudes toward violent parenting, or children’s behaviors.
We also study the heterogeneity by caregiver’s sex. We find that the program’s overall unintended negative effects on mental health outcomes were concentrated among men: treated male caregivers’ stress and anxiety levels increased by 0.108 SD and 0.095 SD relative to the males in the control group. We observe no significant impact on women’s mental health.10 We also observe that, while the intervention led to 0.137 SD fewer interactions between male caregivers and children, it had no impact on this outcome among women. Finally, we find that the intervention reduced female caregivers’ reported use of physical violence by 0.098 SD but had no effect among men. Overall, our results show that the caregiver’s sex plays an empirically significant role in moderating the impact of this digital parenting intervention.
We conduct several robustness checks to validate our findings. We first address potential concerns about selective attrition between the treatment and control groups. For both the overall sample and when split by caregivers’ sex, our tests reveal no evidence of differential attrition. Addressing potential experimenter demand effects, we follow the methodology of Asadullah et al. (2021), evaluating changes in the caregivers’ social desirability index.11 We find no evidence that desirability bias changed among treated caregivers, regardless of their sex. Furthermore, including the social desirability index as an additional control does not affect the coefficients nor their standard errors, and, following Dhar et al. (2022), we find no heterogeneous effects based on the social desirability index. On a related issue, we discuss the existing literature to document the extent to which our results could have been driven by a change in the participants’ awareness of their mental health status. Subsequently, we assess the likelihood of spillovers within our experimental setting. While definitive conclusions about contamination across treatment arms are elusive due to lack of data to purposely test for it, our results from various tests indicate that it is unlikely that contamination occurred in our study. Finally, we verify the robustness of our results to the exclusion of control variables and to the use of randomization inference to estimate -values, following Young (2019). Our results remain similar in terms of magnitude and statistical significance.

We then explore the potential mechanisms that could explain the intervention’s negative and gendered effects. We provide evidence that indicates that the intervention had a greater negative impact on the mental health of male caregivers who live in more economically deprived households and who cohabitate with a partner. Additionally, we note that the negative impact on the frequency of caregiver–child interactions occurs primarily among male caregivers living with a partner. This finding indicates that parenting interventions may make men who cohabitate rely more on their partners to parent at a cost to their own (males’) mental health. </s>"

Finding_II:Individuals with DSL access are less likely to sleep between 7 and 9 hours, the recommended sleep duration.
Finding_III:Individuals with DSL access are less satisfied with their sleep. </s><s>Assistant: We first document the relationship between digital temptations and sleep using data drawn from the German Time Use Survey (German TUS) on sleep duration, time spent playing video games, using computer and smartphones, and watching television and videos/DVDs. Among teenagers (aged 13–19) and young adults (aged up to 30), there is a significant association between the likelihood of reporting insufficient sleep and time spent on computer games or watching TV and videos/DVDs in the evening. Among adults of older ages (aged 31–59), we also find evidence of a significant correlation between shorter sleep duration and the use of computers and smartphones. Interestingly, these associations survive to the inclusion of individual fixed-effects. This descriptive evidence motivates us to further investigate the causal nexus between digital temptations and sleep outcomes. Therefore, we examine the effects of access to high-speed Interneet (DSL) technology on sleep duration and sleep satisfaction using data drawn from the SOEP. Since Internet access increases the marginal utility of PC and tablets use, we hypothesize that it may lead to more technology use near bedtime, which in turn may affect sleep duration and sleep quality (Demirci, Akg?nül, Akpinar, 2015, Lemola, Perkinson-Gloor, Brand, Dewald-Kaufmann, Grob, 2015, Young, 1998). The main empirical challenge is that DSL access may be correlated with unobservable socio-demographic characteristics that simultaneously influence access to high-speed Internet and sleep duration. To tackle this potential endogeneity bias, we follow the IV approach proposed by Falck et al. (2014), who study the effects of Broadband on voting behavior. Their identification relies on the fact that the location of the main distribution frames (MDFs) across Germany was determined by historical circumstances unlikely to be correlated with the demand for high-speed Internet access. The idea underlying this strategy is that while the distance of a household from the MDF is a crucial cost factor for the adoption of DSL connection, the historical distribution of MDFs across Germany can be considered exogenous to current preferences for Internet access. Using confidential information on the residential geo-coordinates of the SOEP households, we calculate the distance of each household from the MDF. Furthermore, we also exploit the fact that several regions in East Germany adopted the optical access line (OPAL) technology in the early 1990s. While this telephone infrastructure was considered a state-of-the art technology at the time, it turned out to be incompatible with DSL technology. Thus, areas that adopted the OPAL technology in the 1990s faced higher barriers to broadband Internet deployment. In this paper, we rely on the variation in Broadband access induced by these historical peculiarities of the German communication network to identify the causal impacts of high-speed Internet on sleep duration and sleep satisfaction.

Our findings reveal a large, negative impact of high-speed Internet on sleep duration. Individuals with DSL access tend to sleep 25 min less than their counterparts without DSL Internet. They are significantly less likely to sleep between 7 and 9 h, the interval typically recommended by the scientific community (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). Furthermore, they are less likely to be satisfied with their sleep. These effects are mostly concentrated among younger adults. Consistent with what found by Giuntella et al. (2017) and Giuntella and Mazzonna (2017), the effects are larger among individuals facing time constraints in the morning due to work schedules or family duties. </s>"

Finding_III:The combination of 3G coverage and smartphone adoption is associated with a significant increase in the accident rate, suggesting that the advanced functions of smartphones while driving contribute to higher accident rates. </s><s>Assistant: Our initial results from fixed-effects Poisson regressions show that there is a statistically significant increase in the accident rate along a road segment once smartphone usage becomes available. At least two notable findings are observed in event study results. First, there is not a significant change in the accident rate prior to a road being treated with our measure of smartphone usage, reducing concerns that trends in the accident rate are biasing the estimated effect of smartphone use. Second, when we set the adoption of smartphones to occur earlier than 2009, the potential effect of 3G coverage on accident rates is delayed. When the adoption of smartphones is assumed to occur in 2010, there is an increase in the accident rate that precedes estimated smartphone use. The event study results suggest smartphone use by drivers began in 2009 and after that time, accident rates increase significantly when gaining 3G coverage.

Without further details about the cause of accidents, we are unable to determine the exact mechanism driving our results. However, a plausible story emerges from our analysis linking 3G coverage, the growth of smartphones and accident rates. When 3G coverage first became available in the mid-2000s, the functionality of cell phones did not immediately change, and accident rates and early 3G coverage are unrelated. Following the release of the 3G-compatible iPhone and Android smartphones in late-2008, there was an increase in mobile broadband subscriptions, text messaging and accessing of the internet while driving (Anderson, 2011). After restricting the first year of smartphone adoption to be 2009, we find a significant increase in the accident rate in areas where 3G is available. Our results suggest that 3G coverage alone does not appear to be responsible for traffic accidents, but the combination of 3G coverage and smartphone adoption is associated with an increase in the accident rate. </s>"

Finding_II:The new racquets favored younger players at the expense of older ones.
Finding_III:Intergenerational inequality increased as a result of the skill-altering technological change. </s><s>Assistant: We find that the introduction of the new composite racquets substantially disrupted the tour, with repercussions lasting for between two and four generations. It temporarily reduced the rank correlation in player quality over time, helped younger players at the expense of older ones, reduced the average age of tennis players, and increased exit rates of older players relative to younger ones. We find that inter-generational inequality rose, though we find mixed evidence for the new racquets’ effects on cross-sectional inequality. We also consider competing explanations, but we conclude that they cannot explain many of the other patterns we find. Moreover, when we compare the ages of tennis players with other Olympic athletes, we do not find a similar drop in the ages of Olympic athletes during the same time period.

While tennis provides an ideal setting for documenting skill-altering technical change, the phenomenon extends far beyond tennis. Consider the case of farmers during the mid-twentieth century. It is difficult to overstate the effect of the rise of tractors on the nature of farming. While tractors made all farmers more productive, they also had subtler effects on optimal farming practices. With a tractor, the traditional approach to farming, which relied on work animals, gave way to new farming techniques that relied on machines. Thus, farmers who had spent a lifetime investing in animal husbandry skills saw the value of their skills eroded by the arrival of tractors. As another example, consider the development of computer-aided drafting in architecture during the 1980s, discussed in MacDonald and Weisbach (2004). This new software devalued drafting and engineering skills relative to artistic skills when designing new buildings. Older architects found the transition difficult, with the New York Times reporting that “as young architects plunge into the high-tech tide, older colleagues wade in gingerly.”1 In both examples, the new technology altered the relative value of different skills in an occupation. Consistent with skill-altering technical change, Fig. 1 shows that the average age in those occupations fell temporarily relative to the general population just after the new technology arrived. </s>"

Second, workers predict small causal wage penalties for a given worker switching between full- and part-time employment. Third, perceived raw and causal wage gaps are significantly correlated. Fourth, providing correlational information strongly affects beliefs about causal effects. Fifth, de-biasing effectively reduces selection neglect. Taken together, the results provide empirical evidence of causal misperceptions in the context of the part-time wage penalty. Although individuals do not na?vely equate average pay gaps with causal effects, they seem to account only insufficiently for worker selection. In addition, we show that beliefs about part-time pay gaps are predictive of labor supply choices, necessitating the prevention of causal misperceptions to avoid behavioral distortions. </s>"
"<s>Human: Write the 'research findings' with the information below:Finding_I:Earnings inequality in Germany increased significantly during the post-unification and Hartz reforms periods and remained high thereafter.
Finding_II:The main driver of rising earnings inequality in Germany is the increasing covariance between working hours and wages, particularly among male and female service sector employees.
Finding_III:The inability to realize optimal working hours, especially among female service sector employees, contributes significantly to rising earnings inequality. </s><s>Assistant: To preview our results, earnings inequality in terms of the MLD increases significantly from 0.19 to 0.29 during the post-unification and Hartz reforms periods and plateaus at a high level thereafter. The MLD decomposition reveals that only 10% of the increase in earnings inequality result from rising wage inequalities, but that rising working hours inequalities and especially the increasing covariance between working hours and wages play the predominant role. Since the 2000s, in contrast to earlier years, low wages are more often connected to low working hours. This changing pattern turns out to be the main driver of rising earnings inequality in Germany. With regard to the changing composition of the work force, rising wage inequality among male service sector employees is the most important contributor to increased inequality in hourly wages. Increasing inequality in hours can be fully attributed to rising working hours inequality among male and female service sector employees. These two subgroups are also responsible for the increased covariance between hours and wages.

Turning to the counterfactual earnings distribution, we also find an increase in earnings inequality, which mostly occurs in the post-unification and the Hartz reforms period. However, this increase is only about half the size of what is observed for the actual earnings distribution, with the MLD of counterfactual earnings increasing from 0.20 to 0.25. The MLD decomposition reveals that the attenuated increase in counterfactual earnings inequality is due to lower growth in the contributing factors of hours inequality and the covariance. The differences of inequalities in counterfactual and actual earnings are most pronounced—and rising—among female service sector employees. Here, inequality in counterfactual earnings and its three components remain constant over time. In other words, the inability to realize optimal working hours—particularly in the growing group of female service sector employees—contributes significantly to rising earnings inequality.

Our study also reveals changes in patterns of mismatch between desired and actual working hours. The share of overemployed people, those who work more hours than they would prefer, increases by seven percentage points among employees in the top quintile of hourly wages. At the same time, the share of underemployed people, those who prefer longer working hours, almost triples among employees in the bottom quintile. Additionally, we find increasing shares of underemployment among male and female employees in the service sector. These results also hold true after controlling for a broad set of control variables in multivariate regressions. Moreover, the regressions reveal that children are a major statistical explanation for underemployment among women, but not among men. This contradicts the notion that reduced working hours among mothers fully reflect their own choices and preferences. </s>"

Finding_III:The summertime mortality rate declined by up to 0.4 percent, corresponding to 1,975 fewer premature deaths per summer in the NBP states, mainly among individuals 75 and older. </s><s>Assistant: 5.
The empirical analysis produces several key results. First, there was a substantial decline in air pollution emissions and ambient concentrations. Figure 1 illustrates the dramatic effect of this market on NOx emissions in the states participating in the NBP.2 In 2001–2002, daily NOx emissions were fairly flat throughout the calendar year, with a peak in summer. In 2005–2007, NOx emissions were nearly 40?percent lower but almost entirely during the summer months when the NBP was in force. NOx emissions are a primary ingredient in the complex function that produces ozone air pollution, so it is unsurprising that we find that the large reductions in NOx led to declines in mean ozone concentrations of roughly 6 percent and reduced the number of summer days with high ozone levels (i.e., more than 65 ppb) by about 35 percent, or a third of a standard deviation.                                               6.
Second, these improvements in air quality produced substantial benefits.  Medication expenditures decreased by about 1.6 percent or roughly $800 million  annually in the 19 eastern and midwestern United States where the NBP was in  force; this is close to an upper bound estimate of the NBP’s total abatement costs.  This decline in medication expenditures is evident both among short-acting respiratory medications taken in response to the presentation of respiratory symptoms  and long-term control medications that are taken to prevent these episodes. Since  people can engage in other defensive investments like avoiding time outdoors or  purchasing air filters, medication expenditures provide a lower bound on the total  defensive costs associated with air pollution. Further, the summertime mortality rate  declined by up to 0.4 percent, corresponding to 1,975 fewer premature deaths per  summer in the NBP states, mainly among individuals 75 and older. The application  of age-adjusted estimates of the value of a statistical life (Murphy and Topel 2006) implies this reduced mortality is valued at about $1.3 billion annually. The mortality  estimates are less precise than the medication ones, and the results must be interpreted accordingly. Additionally, there is little systematic evidence of an effect of the NBP on hospitalization charges. Overall, it is striking that defensive investments  account for more than one-third of our estimate of total WTP for reductions in NOx emissions.    
7. 
Third, the paper provides the first instrumental variables estimates of the effect of NOx emissions on health and defensive investments. Such information is an essential determinant of air quality policy since NOx is a pollutant that can be controlled directly by regulation, whereas ozone cannot be. Ambient ozone is determined by a complex function based on several factors including NOx emissions, volatile organic compound emissions (VOCs), and temperature. These estimates suggest a significant causal link between NOx emissions, medication purchases, and mortality. For example, we find that a 10 percentage point (pp) reduction in NOx emissions leads to 0.06 to 0.011 pp reduction in medication purchases and also an 0.04 to 0.07 pp reduction in mortality. Further, it may be appropriate to conclude the reductions in ozone concentrations stemming from the reductions in NOx emissions are the primary channel for these health improvements; we cautiously report instrumental variable estimates that reveal positive relationships between ambient ozone concentrations and medication expenditures and mortality rates, respectively.                                                                                                                               </s>"

Finding_II:Emerging markets have larger magnitudes of idiosyncratic volatility compared to developed markets.
Finding_III:Financial risk factors, such as foreign exchange stability and foreign debt health, have the highest explanatory power over cross-sectional differences in country-level idiosyncratic risk. </s><s>Assistant: The results from our analyses show that the average country-level unconditional and conditional idiosyncratic volatility do not keep a stable trend. Specifically, the idiosyncratic volatility first increases and reaches a peak during the Asian financial crisis (1997– 1998). After 1998, idiosyncratic volatility demonstrates a downward trend before rising back again during the global financial crisis period of 2007–2008. In 2008, the idiosyncratic volatility reaches an all time high and then gradually decreases until 2016, the end of our sample period. In addition, as one can expect, we find the average country-level idiosyncratic volatility in emerging markets to be larger in magnitude compared to developed markets. Among determinants of country-level idiosyncratic volatility, we find that market turnover has a positive and significant relation with country-level idiosyncratic risk. Moreover, information disclosure and investor uncertainty avoidance degree are all seem to be negatively associated with the country-level idiosyncratic volatility. Lastly, improvements in economic, financial, and political risks, as measured by GDP growth, foreign exchange stability, foreign debt health, and non-corruption degree, decrease the country-level idiosyncratic risk significantly. Similarly, alternative economic and political risk factors, such as price stability, good social development level, good investment environment, and existence and observance of law and order help diminish country-level idiosyncratic volatility as well. Most importantly, among all sets of market structure, investor preference, and economic, financial, and political risk variables considered, we find financial risk factors, namely FX stability and foreign debt health, to have the highest explanatory power (highest adjusted R-squares in our regression specifications) over the cross-sectional differences in country-level idiosyncratic risk. Political risk factors and market structure variables also seem to explain the variation in idiosyncratic volatility across countries to a great extent. On the other hand, GDP growth, our measure for economic risk, and uncertainty avoidance, our measure for investor psychology, seem to have the least explanatory power over differences in country-level idiosyncratic volatility.1 In sum, with this paper, we find a significant connection between idiosyncratic volatility and country-level risk, and identify the best determinants of country-level idiosyncratic risk in international markets. We believe our results will help investors greatly with their risk management decisions in international markets as our findings will assist them identifying which risk factors to focus on to correctly estimate the country-level idiosyncratic risk. </s>"

Finding_II:The negative effect of conflict on a firm's output is non-linear, with the marginal effect becoming smaller for surviving firms as conflict intensity increases.
Finding_III:Conflict impacts more internationalized firms, leading to larger output drops and higher exit probabilities. </s><s>Assistant: Our empirical results are in line with these predictions. First, we show that an increase in the number of conflict events that occurred in the neighborhood of the firm’s location during the year has a highly significant negative effect on revenues. Using different non-linear specifications, we document that this effect is smaller when conflict intensity is higher, thereby indicating that the conflict-induced reduction in revenues is marginally decreasing. To validate our empirical results, we discuss various threats to the identification strategy, and we show that our results are robust to several checks. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that the relationship between conflict and a firm’s performance becomes convex for very high levels of conflict intensity. We then explore the possible mechanisms explaining the non-linear negative effect of conflict exposure on firms’ economic performance. In line with our conceptual framework, we show that conflict reduces the availability of production inputs, namely intermediates and labor, and it induces factors substitution. Specifically, intermediate inputs 1 This context is of intrinsic interest, as the conflict in Libya is one of the geopolitically most relevant of our times (World Bank, 2020). Libya is the major gateway to Europe, with up to 90% of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea departing from its borders (IOM, 2017; UN DESA, 2018; Di Maio et al., 2023). Moreover, Libya is among the main players in Africa’s oil industry, accounting for about 8% of the crude oil supply to the European Union (World Bank, 2020). For these reasons, Libya’s economic stability has important economic, social, and political consequences for neighboring countries, including Europe. decrease following a reduction in the number of suppliers and the firm’s import activity. At the same time, conflict reduces the number of employees, in particular the share of foreign workers. The conflict-induced reduction in inputs availability, by reducing the firm’s potential output, tends to reduce the firm’s economic performance. We label this the production inputs mechanism. We also show that this negative effect is larger for firms using foreign inputs more intensively and that the marginally decreasing effect of conflict is more pronounced for firms using a low share of foreign inputs. As an additional mechanism, we look at the effect of conflict on firms’ exit and market competition. We show that conflict increases the probability of exiting the market, in particular for firms using foreign inputs, and that, for high levels of conflict intensity, the conflict-induced reduction in the number of competitors mitigates the negative effect of conflict on revenues for surviving firms. We label this the market competition mechanism. The combination of these two mechanisms can thus account for the negative impact of conflict on firms’ economic performance and for the fact that its effect is marginally decreasing, more so for firms using less foreign inputs. Finally, to corroborate our findings, we rule out the existence of alternative mechanisms, such as the conflict-induced change in consumer demand, oil production, corruption, and illegal requests of payments to firms.

The DMSP data do not appear to be a suitable proxy for GDP outside of cities, with a negative relationship between DMSP lights and the real GDP of non-urban spatial units, while VIIRS data positively relate to GDP. The negative lights-GDP relationship is especially for rural areas of low population density, in line with the conclusion of Chen and Nordhaus (2011) that luminosity data do not provide reliable estimates of economic activity for low output density regions. A related finding with cross-country data comes from Keola et al. (2015); DMSP night lights negatively relate to GDP if agriculture is a large share of GDP, while there is a positive relationship otherwise. In Indonesia’s urban sector, the lights-GDP relationship is positive irrespective of the type of night lights data used, but the relationship is twice as noisy if the DMSP data are used rather than the VIIRS data. We also find spatial inequality considerably understated by the DMSP data, especially in the urban sector. A Pareto-based adjustment from Bluhm and Krause (2018) to deal with top-coding in DMSP data has a modest effect but the adjusted data still greatly understate spatial inequality, and miss much of the intra-city heterogeneity in brightness (coming from key economic facilities) for Jakarta.

Similar patterns are evident for the other two countries we study. Spatial inequality is understated if the DMSP data are used as a proxy for local economic activity, especially in the urban sector or in higher density regions. Night lights data have higher predictive power for sub-national GDP when working with more aggregated spatial units, such as prov inces, while the gap between DMSP and VIIRS in terms of predictive power gets wider for analyses based on smaller or lower level units within the administrative hierarchy. The data for China allow us to compare lights-GDP relationships in the primary sector with those in industrial and services sectors and this comparison shows that night lights data are a poor proxy for primary sector economic activity. Overall, our results suggest that great caution is needed if development economists use night lights data, not only for low density rural areas but also when studying the spatial patterns of urban development. </s>"

The EMI2 factor has similar but slightly lower average monthly return (0.26%) and ex post Sharpe ratio (0.15). The high level of the equity premium is a well-known puzzle for rational asset pricing theory (Mehra and Prescott, 1985).

Our baseline estimates suggest that an increase in air pollution is positively associated with a higher likelihood and numbers of social conflicts. Furthermore, our instrumental variable approaches yield consistent but substantially larger results compared to the estimates in the baseline fixed effect model, suggesting significant bias if endogeneity is not accounted for. In terms of nonlinearity, the impacts of air pollution on social conflicts display a monotonically increasing pattern, highlighting the need for particular attention to severe air pollution. Our baseline findings are robust to numerous checks, including data manipulation, alternative fixed effects and model specification, alternative instrument using wind patterns, and placebo tests. In addition, we observe a significant difference in the impact of air pollution on social conflicts for indoor vs. outdoor workers, with cumulative effects at the monthly level, while the estimated coefficient is higher in developed regions than in developing regions at the daily frequency level, which may be related to their differences in the awareness of rights defense.

Using data at the subnational level allows for a more detailed spatial description of both climate and economic variables, which has been shown to help identify impacts in economic data3–5 . This is particularly crucial for assessments of rainfall, for which spatial variability is considerably larger than for temperature4 . We explicitly evaluate the spatial autocorrelation of these rainfall measures (Supplementary Fig. 1) at the subnational level of our economic data, the results of which suggest that the level of spatial detail used here is appropriate to address the problem of spatial aggregation (Supplementary Section 1). We then apply fixed-effects panel regression models to estimate the effect of these aspects of the distribution of daily rainfall on economic production. This approach uses within-region changes in climate variables from one year to the next to assess their impact on economic outcomes. As such, it allows us to account for unobserved differences between regions, contemporaneous global shocks and regional time trends (Methods), strengthening the identification of causal effects between changes in rainfall and economic production. </s>"

A firm’s one standard deviation increase in CSR will lead to a 0.655% decrease in IR. Subsequently, we include CSR-squared in our model and find that its coefficient is positive and significant, indicating that the relationship between CSR and IR is U-shaped. To explore the proposed underlying mechanism of this relationship, we analyze the effects of the two moderating variables (OE and AII) on the relationship obtained with the basic model. As we supposed, OE moderates the relationship by shifting the turning point to the right. This means that OE weakens the negative effect of CSR and thus high-OE firms can obtain a lower IR by improving CSR. Mean[1]while, AII moderates the U-shaped relationship by flattening the curve. This indicates that AII inhibits CSR’s positive effect, which conforms to the substitution effect of AII on CSR. These findings verify our analysis of the U-shaped relationship in which CSR has both negative and positive influences on IR.

Finding_II:The reform led to a 10.3 percent increase in GDP per capita and a 3.9 percent increase in nighttime light intensity per square kilometer for counties that experienced current incorporation, compared to counties that would experience the reform several years later.
Finding_III:The positive effects of the reform were not solely driven by a transfer of economic activities, but rather by genuine increases in aggregate economic development. </s><s>Assistant: Our results indicate that the reform significantly increased economic growth in the incorporated counties between 1995 and 2013. Compared to the applied-but-failed counties, the reform raised incorporated counties’ GDP per capita by 11.7 percent and nighttime light intensity per square kilometer by 4.8 percent in ten years. Using the second approach, we find that the reform led to a 10.3 percent increase in GDP per capita and a 3.9 percent increase in nighttime light intensity per square kilometer for counties that experienced current incorporation, compared to counties that would experience the reform several years later. The effect of the reform is both immediate and persistent. In the first year following the reform, the treated counties’ economic growth surpassed that of the control counties, which is possible if there were “immediate” reallocations of resources due to the lifting of inter-regional barriers. We also find that the treated counties still grew faster than the control counties ten years after the reform, suggesting that the effects of the reform were persistent.

To address concerns that the positive effects of the reform on treated counties were due to involuntary migration of economic activity from prefecture-level cities without any gain in overall economic development, we examine the economic growth of both the treated counties and the prefecture-level cities they were incorporated into. If the positive effects of the reform were solely due to a transfer of economic activities, we would expect the overall impact on the treated counties plus their prefecture-level cities to be zero. However, our analysis reveals that the reform increased the total GDP per capita of the treated counties and their prefecture-level cities by 6.6 percent. This finding suggests that the positive effects of the reform were not solely driven by a transfer of economic activities, but rather by genuine increases in aggregate economic development.

After establishing the positive impact of the reform that incorporated counties into prefectures, we explore its underlying mechanisms. We first explore whether the reduction in market barriers can potentially explain the positive effect of the reform. Constrained by available data, we examine the empirical evidence for reductions in frictions in the product market, the labor market, and firm entry and exit. To achieve this, we utilize the Annual Industrial Surveys, a comprehensive firm panel dataset conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics.3

In the product market, our investigation initially focuses on whether inter-regional trade barriers have been reduced since counties were incorporated. To measure the degree of such trade barriers, we follow (Bai et al., 2004) and examine the negative correlation between an industry’s share of SOEs and its level of geographical concentration. This is because local governments tend to prioritize protection for SOEs over other types of enterprises, leading to less competition and geographic specialization in industries with high shares of SOEs. We expand upon (Bai et al., 2004)’s provincial-level findings by examining this negative correlation at the county level, where we find that it still holds true. Importantly, our analysis reveals a significant reduction in this negative correlation within treated counties compared to control counties following the reform.

Next, we explore whether treated counties reallocated towards their most productive sectors following the reform. According to Melitz (2003), international trades induce reallocations towards more productive firms where they enter export markets and absorb shares from less productive ones. Our hypothesis is that since the reform eliminated product market barriers, treated counties should specialize more in industries where they have comparative advantages. Our findings show that production shares for the most productive sector increased by 2 percentage points on average after the reform within treated counties — representing a 25 percent increase from their original levels.4

In the labor market, we investigate whether there were any population increases in treated counties following the removal of labor market barriers through reform. However, our findings did not reveal any significant changes in the size of the registered population within these treated counties.5 It is possible that there were no substantial migration barriers between counties and prefectures even before the reform. Alternatively, it could also be plausible that people – especially those who were already registered in prefectures prior to incorporation – migrated to these treated counties without changing their residence. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, we cannot verify this hypothesis.

Lastly, we demonstrate that the reform reduces barriers to entry and exit for firms. We observe an immediate and consistent increase in firm entries in treated counties compared to control counties after the implementation of the reform. This immediacy suggests that infrastructure enhancements are not responsible for these entries since they require time to establish. Regarding barriers to exit, our findings indicate that less profitable firms in treated counties were significantly more likely to leave after the reform was implemented. This aligns with the mechanism that reducing entry and exit barriers increases competition among firms, which compels less profitable ones to withdraw (Melitz, 2003).

An alternative explanation for the positive effect is that this reform alters government structure and behavior, leading to increased growth in incorporated counties. We explore several potential changes in government behavior resulting from this reform. Firstly, an increase in inter-governmental fiscal transfers from the prefecture-level government may allow governments of incorporated counties to spend more. Secondly, it could be because more state-owned enterprises are being subordinated by the prefecture to incorporated counties which contribute to economic growth there. Thirdly, treated counties may become more likely targets for subsequent growth-oriented reforms which drive output increases; one such example is the “economic zones” reform, which has been shown by Lu et al. (2019) to significantly promote growth in counties with these zones.6 However, after examining each of these changes individually, we found no significant difference between incorporated and control counties — suggesting that none of these factors can fully explain our results. </s>"

Finding_III:Chinese demand mitigated the deforestation impacts arising from GE soy seeds, as areas highly exposed to both shocks underwent a transition from cultivating other crops to soybeans, reducing the relative impact of GE soy on deforestation. </s><s>Assistant: Our findings unveil the distinct impacts of these two shocks and underscore the necessity of considering them together. When examining the effects of trade and productivity in isolation, we find that municipalities more exposed to the rising export demand from China experienced a more rapid decline in forest cover compared to less exposed areas. Similarly, municipalities with greater exposure to productivity gains from GE soy seeds experienced increased deforestation compared to areas that did benefit from the new technology. However, when these two are considered together, we find that only the GE soy seed shock remains statistically significant and economically meaningful. This implies that one would arrive at different conclusions regarding the impact of local exposure to export demand when analyzing it in isolation from the largest agricultural technological shock during that period.

We then investigate the combined effects of being exposed to both GE soy seeds and Chinese demand by adding an interaction between the two shocks to our econometric model. We find that while Chinese demand did not seem to exert a substantial direct differential impact on deforestation, it mitigated the deforestation impacts arising from GE soy seeds. This is because municipalities highly exposed to both shocks underwent a transition from cultivating other crops to soybeans, relieving pressure on the primary ecosystem and thereby reducing the relative impact of GE soy on deforestation.

We also break down the impacts on the extensive margin of crop production. We find that exposure to GE seeds increases the likelihood that a municipality engages in soy production, with this effect being more pronounced in municipalities exposed to both shocks. Interestingly, Chinese demand appears to have decreased the probability of soy cultivation in a given municipality. These findings suggest that GE seeds pushed soy production to areas that were previously economically unviable, with the effect being stronger in areas concurrently exposed to Chinese demand shocks. However, the soy extensive margin impact of the combined shocks was not enough to drive deforestation up, because of the reduction in the area allocated to other crops and in the probability of these other crops being planted. </s>"

Finding_II:Licensed businesses also had higher monthly business profits compared to unlicensed businesses.
Finding_III:The presence of market imperfections and restrictions on cash transfers led to higher prices in the new market for digital cash transfers or vouchers. </s><s>Assistant: We find that the applicants selected to get a license massively benefit from the cash transfer program. Licensed applicants have monthly business revenues that are 3784 USD higher on average than unlicensed applicants (＋175%).6 The effect of licenses on profits is also positive and large. Applicants who received a license have monthly business profits that are 685 USD higher on average than unlicensed applicants (＋154%). Licensed applicants also have more employees and higher labor productivity, they sell a larger variety of commodities, and their households have higher living standards than the control group.

These massive effects are partly explained by the fact that successful applicants are more likely to have a business (＋24 percentage points), but also that licensed businesses are much more successful than unlicensed businesses. We estimate that the effect of getting a license on profits is higher than 526 USD per month (＋86%) for businesses that would exist even in the absence of cash transfer program. This estimate, which is a lower-bound, is extremely large, about 18 times the average monthly wage of paid employees (about 29 USD) and 39 times the value of monthly food assistance per refugee (about 13 USD). Importantly, we find no significant effect on sales for hard cash, suggesting that negative spillovers between licensed and unlicensed businesses are limited.

The large profits observed in the food retail sector provide evidence of market imperfections in Kakuma and Kalobeyei. These market imperfections have been magnified by the digital cash transfer program. Using data from a household survey, we find that households are charged higher prices for purchases paid with digital cash transfers compared to purchases with hard cash. The digital cash transfer program has generated two parallel markets. On the one hand, the market for hard cash transactions is relatively competitive, with about 1400 shops offering low prices to attract consumers. On the other hand, the new market for digital cash transfers is restricted to 252 licensed vendors which can charge higher prices. Because of market imperfections, licensed businesses capture part of the benefits of the cash transfer program. Our analysis suggests that most refugees would gain from policies addressing these market imperfections.

More generally, our findings caution against the establishment of a less competitive, parallel market for distributing cash-based assistance. Organizations implementing cash-based interventions should identify and address market imperfections to limit rent-seeking by businesses and maximize positive impacts on cash transfer recipients. How to do that effectively is a topic for future research. </s>"

Finding_II:EZs with female-dominated industries have a significant impact on improving women's intra-household bargaining power.
Finding_III:The establishment of EZs in China increases the probability of women being employed in the non-agricultural sector, leading to increased female income. </s><s>Assistant: The analyzes proceed in four stages. First, using the establishment of EZs during the sample period as a natural experiment, we examine the impact of EZs on self-reported intra-household decision-making by using a reduced-form approach. We find that exposure to EZs significantly increases the probability of a mother making a decision. However, given that self-reported proxies for bargaining power suffer from subjective biases, we recognize that a more precise measure of the allocation of resources within the household is needed to overcome this limitation.

Second, we apply a structural model of intra-household allocation to estimate resource shares, that is, the fraction of total household spending allocated to each family member (Browning et al., 2013). Since the allocation of household resources is unobserved in practice and hard to identify, we employ a collective household model (see Chiappori, 1988, Chiappori, 1992, Browning and Chiappori, 1998) to estimate resource shares. In this framework, each family member has a separate utility function over goods, and the household is Pareto efficient in its allocation of goods. Resource shares are identified by comparing Engel curves of food items consumed exclusively by a particular person type, such as men, women, and children (Dunbar et al., 2013). From our dataset, we find that the EZ program has a significant and positive impact on women’s bargaining power and their ability to access household resources. Specifically, we estimate that exposure to EZs increases women’s resource shares by 1.68 percentage points for all households and 1.87 percentage points for households with children. These findings are determined to be robust by using the matched sample that addresses the potential endogeneity of EZs’ establishment. These structural estimates are consistent with the reduced-form evidence. Both support the importance of the EZ program in shaping women’s position within the household.

Third, to further understand the factors underlying the improvement in women’s bargaining power, we examine the relationship between prominent industries of EZs and women’s resource shares using the information from China Development Zone Audit Announcement. Results show that the improvement of women’s intra-household bargaining power is almost entirely driven by EZs with female-dominated industries, indicating that the creation of labor market opportunities for women is the main driving force behind the increase of women’s resource shares. Then, we examine the impact of the EZ program on rural employment using individual-level data. Our results show that the establishment of EZs significantly increases the probability of women being employed in the non-agricultural sector and the sectoral reallocation increases female income. These results shed new light on the mechanisms and magnitudes of these popular policy tools.

Fourth, we analyze the impact of place-based policies on children’s outcomes of interest. EZs may influence women’s bargaining power and employment status, which, in turn, has impacts on the way they support and raise their children. We show that the dropout probability of children decreases by more than 4% when households live near EZs and girls benefit more from women’s bargaining power compared with boys in China. </s>"

Finding_II:The ability to identify the enemy affects the certainty of whom people can trust.
Finding_III:Low exposure to violence fosters social capital, but as violence becomes more severe, social capital is negatively affected. </s><s>Assistant: Broadly, this paper presents three sets of results. First, at the mean, violence has a negative and statistically significant effect on different measures of social capital. The estimated effect is quantitatively large and robust to alternative explanations of spillover effects and economic activity. A one standard deviation increase in the rate of violence is associated with a 38%, 22%, and 23% standard deviation decrease in trust, participation in community organizations, and contribution to solving problems, respectively. The magnitude of the effect is relatively large; taking trust as an example, this corresponds to the difference in trust levels between Germany and Colombia.6 Second, these results seem to be driven by the fact that (as observed in other non-related conflicts) no basic cues were available to identify friend from foe, making people especially wary about whom they could trust. To this regard, I present evidence that individuals were afraid to interact with their communities. Indeed, they report a fear of running in local elections as well as of participating in community organizations as a result of non-identifiable perpetrators.

Finally, I document that the intensity of the exposure to violence matters as well. Low exposure to violence fosters social capital, possibly because local cooperation serves as a strategy to confront external threats. However, as violence becomes increasingly severe, social capital is negatively affected, consistent with the theoretical framework presented by Jennings and Sanchez-Pages (2017). My estimates imply that individuals living in a Colombian municipality with the same level of violence as in the U.S., become more involved with their communities when experiencing violence, arguably a way of reacting in difficult times. This contrasts with an observed decrease in social capital in municipalities that have experienced levels of violence similar to Brazil or Mexico. Additionally, I show that when communities are able to identify the perpetrators, the decrease in social capital is less strong as compared to when it is not possible to identify the perpetrators. Thus, the results of this study provide crucial insights for understanding the effects of conflict in other developing countries. </s>"

In exploring the mechanisms underpinning these findings, we find evidence of increased contraceptive use, increased access to healthcare and better health outcomes for women and children, which suggest a shift towards a “quality over quantity” approach to parenting. In addition, we observe a shift in parents' employment away from farming toward more clerical jobs as well as sales and service sectors, which have higher labour productivity and higher salaries, resulting in a higher childbearing opportunity cost. </s>"

Finding_III:Impacted households adjust their crop mix toward a portfolio with a larger share of heat-resistant but lower-value crops in the three years after the heat shock. </s><s>Assistant: We find that extreme heat significantly reduces corn yields and leads to substantial economic losses of corn-growing households in northeast China. A one-standard-deviation increase in harmful degree days (HDD) – a measure of extreme heat – decreases corn yields by more than 11% (significant at the 0.001 level) and leads to a roughly 6% reduction in total farm revenue (significant at the 0.05 level). Although the economic loss is substantial, the impacted households have successfully smoothed their consumption. Our results show that increasing HDD has almost no contemporaneous effect on the household’s total living expenses and itemized expenditures on food, fuel, service, and inter-household transfers. The consumption impact is also very limited in the post-shock years, given that we only observe a modest curtailment in the non-essential demand in years after the households experience heat shocks.

We illustrate that the households smooth their consumption mainly through using liquid financial assets and available buffer stocks. Leveraging detailed information on various assets, we find that both cash in hand and corn stocks are significantly drawn down when the households experience an increase in HDD, especially among the households who regularly maintain these buffers. We interpret these smoothing behaviors as evidence that the households have engaged in precautionary saving as a coping strategy for unanticipated income shocks. Consistent with this motive, we find that the impacted households promptly re-build their depleted financial assets and stocks in years after experiencing extreme heat. In our context, utilizing cash and stocks for compensating heat-induced revenue losses is proven to be very effective. With a decomposition analysis, we show that the cash savings would mitigate roughly half of the revenue loss and the stocks would compensate for another one third.

With the capability of smoothing consumption effectively, the corn households in our context may have a low incentive for engaging in costly contemporaneous production adjustments. Indeed, unlike within-season input adjustments documented in other developing country contexts, we find no significant response among rural households in northeast China in any of the variable inputs including fertilizer, pesticides, power, labor, and irrigation use, and there has also been no contemporaneous adjustment in land use. However, forward-looking households may adjust production in response to past shocks, anticipating potential losses induced by extreme heat in the future. In particular, we find that, over the three years after the shock, the impacted households adjust their crop mix toward a portfolio with a larger share of heat-resistant but lower-value crops, consistent with the precautionary-saving motive reflected in their asset management. </s>"

Finding_II:The integration does not significantly affect overall university enrollment, but it changes the composition of enrollment by institution type.
Finding_III:The integration has positive equity effects, as low-income students are more likely to enroll in university due to reduced application costs. </s><s>Assistant:  We begin by showing that, as expected, the platform integration increased the number of platform users by 13 percentage points (pp.) and decreased the proportion of students rejecting a G25 offer. This last result implies a more efficient market that suffers less from waitlist congestion. However, we find that the platform integration did not affect student's university enrollment in the subsequent years but changed their enrollment composition by institution type in a dynamic way. The year of the market integration, student's G8 and G25 enrollment remain unchanged; but one year after the integration, student's G8 enrollment increases by 3pp. (statistically significant at 5% level) and G25 enrollment decreases 1.6pp. (non-statistically significant). These effects are also followed by an increase in student's sorting into programs. We provide suggestive evidence that the mentioned effects are driven by the release of previous year admission cutoffs for programs joining the platform, which happens the year after the integration (the integration year there is not previous year platform cutoffs).7 The historical admission cutoff seems to inform student's about their probability of being admitted into a program and therefore, induce more informed student's decisions. Finally, we show that low-income students are 3.6pp. more likely to enroll in university after the integration. This seems to happen because of lower student's application costs to new platform university after the platform integration. All results together suggests that application and cutoff information costs could affect student's decision making and that the platform integration has both equity and efficiency effects.

We show that our results are robust to alternative explanations. First, we show that results are not driven by the platform integration increasing the fraction of students taking the test or meeting the platform usage requirements. Second, we also evaluate whether the integration increased the fraction of students in the control group interested and enrolled in G8 commuting zone universities. Using data on ex-ante preferences of study location, we show that control group students do not seem to prefer more G8 commuting zone universities after the integration. Third, results do not change if students’ location restriction is set at the regional rather than at the commuting zone level. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that universities did not react by increasing the number of seats, degrees offered or increasing their enrollment yield. </s>"

Finding_II:The 'dumsor' power crisis in Ghana increased unemployment by 4.7 percentage points.
Finding_III:Outages are associated with a 4.7 to 13.5 percentage point increase in unemployment in the region. </s><s>Assistant: The main finding of the paper is that electricity outages exert a non-trivial negative impact on employment. From the cross-country analysis, I find that outages reduce the probability of employment by about 13.5 percentage points (pp). The results of the country case studies in Ghana and Nigeria also show a negative effect of outages on employment that are economically and statistically significant, albeit with relatively low magnitudes. The estimates suggest that the “dumsor” power crisis in Ghana increased unemployment by 4.7 pp. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, outages are associated with a 5.7 pp increase in unemployment. Thus, overall, the estimates suggest that outages are associated with a 4.7 pp to 13.5 pp increase in unemployment in the region. Additionally, evidence from the paper suggests that the effects are largely concentrated in employment in non-agricultural sectors and skilled jobs. Employment of unskilled workers is unaffected by outages. Also, the job losses associated with outages are largely borne by private-sector workers, highlighting the response of private firms to unfavorable business conditions.

Further, the paper shows evidence of a reduction in firm entry and performance of incumbent firms as plausible channels through which electricity outages affect employment. In relation to firm entry, evidence from the Ethiopian firm census data shows manufacturing firms have a lower tendency of operating in places with a high prevalence of outages. The effects are even more pronounced among firms in high energy-intensive sectors, highlighting the importance of reliable supply of energy to firms in such sectors. Even among incumbent firms, those operating in areas with an unreliable supply of power operate for shorter duration(s) relative to firms in places with reliable supply, due to the negative effects of outages on capacity utilization. The evidence from Ghana also lends support to the findings on the negative impact of outages on firm entry. Our findings suggest that the “dumsor” power crisis (2012–2016) in Ghana led to a 12.3% decline in FDI.7 Rising cost of doing business and unfavorable macroeconomic shocks induced by the crisis are plausible explanations behind the slump in FDI. As a result, new businesses that would have otherwise created jobs were lost.

Secondly, in relation to the negative effect of outages on the performance of incumbent firms, I find that, for instance, a percent increase in the frequency of outages experienced by firms reduces sales, sales per worker, and value-added per worker by 1.2%, 1.3%, and 2.3% respectively. Labor demand also falls in response to exposure to outages, with the employment of temporary workers the most affected: a percent increase in outage frequency (duration) is associated with a 0.58% (0.32%) reduction in the number of temporary workers hired by firms. The effect on demand for full-time workers is also negative albeit statistically insignificant. In addition, the results show a negative and significant effect of outages on total labor cost and labor cost per worker. This provides suggestive evidence that firms, perhaps, respond to the declining revenue induced by outages by reducing wages. </s>"

From the theoretical model, we bring in the empirical tests of a gravity model consistent with the theoretical predictions. We find that an increase in rural cohort size by 1,000 people pushes 125 rural migrants out of the origin prefecture, while a reduction in urban cohort sizes in destination prefectures by 1,000 people pulls 769 rural migrants into the destination prefecture. Besides the demography of migration, the economies of agglomeration work in the opposite direction: An increase in urban population size by 1,000 people attracts 352 rural migrants from the less developed origin prefecture. Our results are also robust to various concerns, including differential trends by the initial development levels, institutional reforms on the household registration system, trade-induced demand shocks, and the measurement of migration flows. Compared with cross-country studies, the study of internal migration within a country limits the size of unobserved heterogeneity, e.g., differences in labor market institutions. Our findings on the asymmetric impact of pull and push factors, i.e., the effects of push factors are smaller than that of pull factors, are also emphasized in the international migration literature (Mayda, 2010). </s>"

We carry out a battery of checks on potential issues arising from the confounding variations in weather and climate, agricultural and land-use policies, crop prices, socioeconomic factors of the local rural economy, irrigation status, and issues related to sample selection and measurement errors in the data. These checks illustrate that our estimated long-run climate effects are highly robust.

The benchmark estimates suggest that a person living 10 km from a historical mission is approximately 4 percentage points less likely to have undergone FGC than someone living 100 km from a mission site. For respondents living in areas where FGC was practiced in pre-colonial times, the equivalent difference is 6 percentage points. The estimated effects are robust to a number of specifications and control variables.

To investigate potential mechanisms, we match our data on FGC and missions with granular geo-spatial data on night lights and on the size of urban agglomerations and use within-survey data on education, religious affiliation and urban residence. Controlling for these possible mechanisms has little impact on estimates. While we cannot provide direct evidence, this is consistent with an impact of missions on norms, which has then persisted. We also investigate the impact of number of missions in respondents' ancestral ethnic homelands. One more historical mission per 1000 km2 in the respondents’ ethnic homeland decreases the likelihood of FGC by on average 8 percentage points. The impact of missions in the ancestral ethnic homeland remains significant when we include missions in the geographic ethnic homeland where they currently live, arguably highlighting the role of intergenerational norm transmission within ethnic groups. </s>"

Finding_III:Underreporting of income is greater when information is more difficult to observe and less likely to be verified. </s><s>Assistant: I document four findings. First, both migrants and their spouses have biased beliefs about each other’s finances. Migrants underestimate their spouses’ income and overestimate their spouses’ expenses, whereas spouses staying behind underestimate migrants’ less-observable non-wage benefits. Second, spouses staying behind underreport their monthly income by 31 percent (213 dirham or USD $58) when it is observable to the migrant, compared to their reported monthly income of 685 dirham (USD $186) when it is not observable to the migrant. This underreporting is even greater when the migrant also participates in the study. Third, among both migrants and their spouses staying behind, women are more likely to underreport income. The majority of spouses staying behind are women, and they play a central role in driving the underreporting of income by spouses staying behind. These gender differences appear to be driven by women limiting misreporting by men by more frequently demanding control over and communicating about the household’s finances. Fourth, underreporting is greater when information is more difficult to observe and less likely to be verified. Spouses staying behind underreport income on the intensive margin by underreporting known sources of income instead of reporting zero income which would be easier for migrants to verify as misreporting. Underreporting only occurs when migrants do not demand control over or regularly communicate about the household’s finances, making them less likely to verify reported information. Together these reporting patterns are consistent with the theory that spouses staying behind strategically underreport their income to influence the remittance decision and this contributes to the information asymmetry between migrants and their spouses. </s>"

""Development stage"": Not specified in the given paragraphs
 </s><s>Assistant: 
The government launched the APRP to facilitate the relocation of poor households from remote, inhospitable areas to places with more work opportunities and a better life. As it is mainly a within-county relocation program, it moves households from villages to nearby towns or the county center by offering either public housing or housing vouchers.2 Households can choose either to move into apartments in public housing communities for free or agree on a fixed amount of subsidy (26,000 Yuan per capita) to purchase or build a new house in a preferred location within the county.

Although households only moved a relatively short distance (refer to Figure E8), APRP facilitated substantial changes with regard to participating households in many aspects (refer to Section 2 and Section 5). First, households moved to less geographically isolated places. The Terrain Ruggedness Index, the average slope of the land, and commuting time to the populated area decreased, and the road density increased after relocation. Second, households moved to more developed places. Population density, electricity consumption, and area of built land were higher in destination regions, while poverty rate was lower. Third, access to amenities increased a lot after relocation because households moved to locations close to schools and health care institutions. We also provide suggestive evidence that school quality is higher in destination regions for the housing voucher group.

Among all causes of poverty in rural areas, the APRP potentially tackles two problems: low productivity in agricultural sector relative to non-agricultural sector (Adamopoulos et al., 2022a; Gollin et al., 2014; Lagakos et al., 2020; Lagakos, 2020; Young, 2013) and the cost of remoteness, which prohibits access to market (Aggarwal, 2018; Asher et al., 2018; Brooks and Donovan, 2020; Provenzano, 2020; Redding and Sturm, 2008). By placing households in regions with more non-agricultural economic activities, the APRP aids in supplementing labor force shifts from agricultural to the non-agricultural sector. Besides, the APRP increases participating households’ market access by directly moving them out of remote areas. However, a positive impact on economic outcomes is not guaranteed. A within-county relocation may not be sufficient in overcoming the mobility barrier across sectors.4 For example, poor households may lack crucial skills for non-agricultural jobs. </s>"

Beginning date: 1995
Main purpose: To control sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions and reduce particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) pollution.
Development stage: Implemented and enforced.
Other information: The ARP created an immediate and persistent drop in SO2 emissions, allowing for an event study analysis to explore dynamic effects. The program regulated only certain SO2-intensive coal plants, comparing changes in mortality over time in counties most impacted by pollution from regulated plants to changes in mortality in counties with little to no related exposure. The program aimed to mitigate bias from national trends changing over time independent of pollution from coal-fired plants. The ARP generated limited economic spillovers and had negligible effects on income, employment, or migration. The program's effects on mortality rates suggest that reductions in long-term pollution concentrations contributed to declining mortality rates.
 </s><s>Assistant: 
In this paper, we estimate the effects of long-run pollution exposure on mortality by exploiting the United States Acid Rain Program (ARP), a cap-and-trade regulation to control sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, which avoids many of the issues associated with identifying long-run effects. First, the ARP created an immediate and persistent drop in SO2, a precursor gas in the formation of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5)1; PM2.5 is a pollutant with detrimental effects on human health (see Environmental Protection Agency (2004) for a comprehensive review). This one-time drop in pollution allows for an event study analysis to explore dynamic effects.

Second, the ARP regulated only certain SO2-intensive coal plants. This lends to a design comparing changes in mortality over time in counties most impacted by pollution from regulated plants to changes in mortality in counties with little to no related exposure. This mitigates bias from national trends changing over time independent of pollution from coal-fired plants, such as business cycles, health care access, and technological advances.

Third, the vast distance both SO2 and PM2.5 travel once airborne subsumes many potential confounding general equilibrium effects. Households sorting in response to the economic effects of the ARP will not bias estimates if such sorting remains within the effective range of pollution transport from a given region.2 Given existing evidence that finds such changes in housing amenity values occur at distances of less than 2 miles, long-distance residential sorting is likely to be limited.
Fourth, the ARP generated limited economic spillovers. While many environmental regulations often lead to job loss (Greenstone, 2002; Walker, 2013), which can have independent effects on health (Sullivan and von Wachter, 2009), this issue is less relevant to the ARP as compliance costs and economic effects were low (Schmalensee and Stavins, 2017).4 Moreover, the broad spread of emissions beyond plants themselves subsumes local economic effects, to the extent they exist, in the same way they deal with sorting. We verify the ARP had negligible effects on income, employment, or migration, suggesting economic effects are unlikely to bias estimates of health effects. </s>"

This paper investigates the complementarities between access to markets and technologies by considering the simultaneous but independently implemented expansions of rural roads and extension in Ethiopia. In the first program, starting in 2004, the government expanded extension services with a goal to provide every village with a farmer training center and three extension agents. Extension services in Ethiopia cover beyond just information sharing and include the provision of subsidized seeds, fertilizer, and credit. Since 2004, the share of farmers who received advisory services increased from 25% to 74%. The second program, the Universal Rural Road Access Program (URRAP), was commenced in 2011 with a budget of over $2 billion in order to connect every village with an all-weather road. By 2017, URRAP doubled the share of villages with an all-weather road to over 76%. The massive scale, concurrent timing and independent expansions of these two programs present an ideal context to study the interactions between access to markets and technologies.

Access to a road and extension can have complementarities because poor connectivity or unavailability of technologies constrain the other factor’s efficacy.  Improvements in the road network may increase agricultural productivity by changing farmers’ access to markets and public services such as extension.  Extension can improve productivity by advising farmers on best technologies, facilitating access to inputs, mobilizing the community to address common problems, and helping households deal with shocks.  However, farmers may not benefit from market access without the relevant know-how and support provided under extension.  Poor roads limit the ability of extension agents to reach farmers.  Farmers may not undertake costly investments in technologies without profitable market opportunities.  Hence, extension and roads together have a stronger effect on productivity because they relax two interdependent rural constraints, access to markets and technologies, simultaneously. </s>"

The program aimed to increase the gains from marriage and improve overall sanitation coverage, but it also resulted in a reduction in the female surplus share.
 </s><s>Assistant: 
Our objective to quantify the added marital gain from sanitation necessarily intersects with two fundamental questions in the study of marriage markets: “Who marries whom?” and “How does the market clear?” This interlinkage poses notable identification challenges which arise from sanitation preferences being correlated with observable (e.g., wealth) and unobservable (e.g., marital preferences) characteristics that are relevant for matching decisions. Moreover, in this case, the division of the gains is endogenous and determined in the marriage market equilibrium. We use a structural approach to provide empirical evidence in support of our argument. A central contribution of this paper is to explicitly model the marriage decisions of men and women in order to decompose the total effect of sanitation programs — in our case, the Government of India (GoI)’s Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC). The TSC was a nationwide program to increase household-level sanitation and focused primarily on the provision of financial incentives. Like sanitation interventions more generally, it considered women to be an important target group as homemakers and caregivers for children, the sick, and the elderly (Cavill et al., 2018, Radtke, 2018). </s>"

 </s><s>Assistant: 
In this paper, we assess the impact of the introduction of ProFuturo, an innovative CAL program present in 38 countries of three continents, which has already reached more than 450,000 teachers and 12 million children. Importantly, the package provided by the ProFuturo program enables tailoring contents to individual student needs. However, two innovative features of the program stand out, which are central to the analysis and contribution of this paper. First, ProFuturo’s main objective is to help regular primary school teachers in their core teaching activities in the classroom, i.e., after significant teacher training, ProFuturo places teachers at the center of the program’s experience. Second, it promotes student interaction with teachers and peers, namely through group work. Apart from the learning software, ProFuturo includes an equipment set composed by individual tablets, which link all students and the teacher in a classroom. We ask in this paper whether the program is effective at familiarizing students and teachers with technology while motivating and improving not only teachers’ teaching but also students’ learning experience in all major contents of regular primary school. We also investigate the effects of the implementation of ProFuturo on children’s cognitive skills

We implemented a randomized field experiment to test the impact of ProFuturo. From the 42 primary schools in Luanda that were selected to receive ProFuturo, 21 were randomized to receive it in the beginning of 2018 and 21 assigned to start using it in 2019. We employ a comprehensive set of measurements, including detailed school principal, teacher, student, and household surveys, three rounds of systematic observation of classes, student standardized tests in Mathematics, Portuguese, and Science, as well as administrative data from schools and the program.

Approximately a year after the program was introduced, we find that it increases the levels of technology usage for both teachers and students. Importantly, teachers’ motivation improves with ProFuturo. Specifically, the program led to a reduction in teachers’ absenteeism. The point estimate is large when employing administrative data: less 0.59 standard deviations in days missed by teachers, which represents a 51 percent reduction. Students also become more motivated, namely towards Mathematics. Central to the program and to our analysis are effects on teacher and student behaviors. Teachers improve the quality of their class preparation and engage more often in active teaching in the classroom. Students devote more time to reading, and to shared time with their guardians using technology. Some evidence also suggests more pro-social interaction between students, in line with ProFuturo’s emphasis on students’ interaction and other-regarding behaviors. Finally, we observe in classrooms higher standards of teacher knowledge. These effects of ProFuturo translate into improved students’ test scores in Science, which was the subject most frequently selected to be taught under ProFuturo. We do not find any significant treatment effects in students’ test scores of other subjects despite the centrality of those contents in the design of ProFuturo.

One pedagogical approach that seems to have a role in student achievement is Computer Assisted Learning (CAL). This includes making hardware available to students along with a specific software designed to develop particular skills. In some cases, this software may adapt and respond to students’ learning needs. This approach may be particularly relevant as schools in developing countries typically have more than a grade per class, a large student–teacher ratio, and highly heterogeneous students. There are promising results of this type of interventions. </s>"

During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union developed extensive international aid programs to build political influence (Gaddis, 2006). For instance, to establish a strategic alliance with the newly-formed Chinese government, the Soviet Union provided China with equipment and technology to help it construct large-scale industrial projects through the 156 Program. The projects substantially mitigated China's shortage of capital and technical knowledge during the initial process of industrialization. However, due to ideological disagreements, the Sino-Soviet diplomatic relationship broke down in 1960 and remained disrupted for about three decades until 1989, two years before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In October 2012, the Colombian government started peace negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC from the Spanish acronym), the largest and oldest guerrilla organization in the Western Hemisphere. After normal ebbs and flows, the main milestone of the peace process came on December 20 of 2014, when FARC declared a permanent ceasefire as a way to signal internal cohesion and a credible commitment to lay down their weapons. The ceasefire was largely met until replaced, on August 29 of 2016, by the definitive bilateral ceasefire and, shortly afterward, by the peace agreement. FARC violence almost completely disappeared. The peace agreement, however, was rejected in a low-turnout national referendum by a 0.5 percentage points vote margin. Moreover, the political party that campaigned for the ‘No’ vote also won the 2018 presidential election, following a platform that promised to ‘tear apart’ the peace agreement. At the same time, violence in former FARC strongholds re-intensified as other armed groups that did not take part of the peace negotiations attempted to contest those territories to expand their influence. In short, the political events that started with FARC’s ceasefire entailed significant variation in violence levels as well as in political and economic uncertainty. We argue that this variation shaped the post-conflict dynamics of entrepreneurship in former FARC strongholds. </s>"

Development stage: Data collection and analysis
Other information: 
- The collection of data needed to assess the effect of conflict on Libyan firms has been impeded by an uncertain political environment and intense conflict-related violence.
 </s><s>Assistant: Our analysis is guided by a simple theoretical framework to study the impact of conflict exposure on firms’ activities. Firms produce by combining domestic and foreign inputs, and high-productivity firms are more intensive in foreign inputs. Conflict exposure for the firm enters the production function as a reduction in the productivity (availability) of these inputs. However, depending on the nature of the conflict, the latter affects inputs’ productivity differently. We show that an increase in conflict intensity decreases output, induces factors’ substitution, and increases firms’ exit. These effects are heterogeneous across firms depending on the intensity of the impact of conflict on different inputs and the input mix adopted by the firm. Two are the novel implications of our theoretical framework. First, the relationship between a firm’s productivity and resilience to conflict depends on the type of conflict. In particular, there is a negative (positive) relationship – i.e., low productivity firms suffer a smaller (larger) output drop – if conflict events affect relatively more (less) foreign inputs. Second, the negative effect of conflict on a firm’s output is non-linear. As conflict intensity increases, its marginal effect becomes smaller for surviving firms.

Night lights data are potentially most valuable for developing countries, because richer countries often have other sources of information on local economic activity, including more conventional data such as sub-provincial (e.g. district or county) GDP estimates.

"<s>Human: Write the 'transition program' with the information below:Program name: Innovative efficiency and stock returns
Enforcer: Not specified
Beginning date: Not specified
Main purpose: To examine the relationship between innovative efficiency and future stock returns and operating performance
Development stage: Not specified
Other information: The program focuses on the difficulty investors face in processing information about firms' future prospects, particularly in relation to new technologies and innovations. It suggests that investors tend to underreact to information about innovative efficiency, leading to undervaluation of firms that are more efficient in innovations. The program also explores the q-theory, which predicts that firms with higher innovative efficiency tend to be more profitable and have higher returns. Limited investor attention is identified as a factor that can cause underreaction and return predictability. The program constructs innovation-related factors and examines their correlation with the Efficient Minus Inefficient (EMI) factors. The EMI factors are found to have higher average monthly returns and Sharpe ratios compared to other factors, suggesting that the IE-return relation captures return predictability effects beyond those captured by other factors. The program also explores the interaction between the IE effect and proxies for limited attention and valuation uncertainty.
 </s><s>Assistant: A firm’s past innovative efficiency can be less salient to investors than explicitly forward-looking information about the prospects for the particular R&D projects that the firm is undertaking. For example, investors devote considerable attention to analyst reports and news articles about the potential outcomes of clinical phase trials conducted by a biotech and pharmaceutical firm, while historical performance of past R&D efforts receives less media attention. According to Kahneman and Lovallo (1993, p. 17), people tend to consider the judgment or decision problem they are facing as unique and, in consequence, ‘‘neglect the statistics of the past in evaluating current plans.’’ Kahneman and Lovallo call a focus on the uniqueness of the problem the ‘‘inside view’’ and a focus on relevant statistical performance data from previous trials the ‘‘outside view.’’ An excessive focus on the inside view implies that people will tend to be over[1]optimistic about prospects for success when they neglect unfavorable non-salient statistical information and tend to be less optimistic, and perhaps over-pessimistic, about the prospects of success, when they neglect favorable statistical information.

Furthermore, extensive evidence exists that individuals pay less attention to, and place less weight upon, information that is harder to process (see, e.g., the review of Song and Schwarz, 2010). Information about innovations is hard to process, because it requires developing and applying a theory of how the economic fundamentals of a firm or its industry are changing. It also requires an analysis of the road from patents to final products on the market, the profit of which can be highly uncertain and long deferred. We would expect such hard-to-process information to be underweighted unless there is some offsetting effect (such as high salience). These considerations suggest that investors will underreact to the information content in innovative efficiency because of the difficulty evaluating the eco nomic implications of patents and patent citations. If so, then firms that are more efficient in innovations will be undervalued relative to firms that are less efficient in innovations. Therefore, we expect a positive relation between innovative efficiency and future stock returns and operating performance. An alternative argument for why innovative efficiency would predict higher future returns derives from the q-theory (Cochrane, 1991, 1996; Liu, Whited, and Zhang, 2009). Firms with higher innovative efficiency tend to be more profitable and have higher return on assets. All else equal, the q-theory implies that higher profitability predicts higher returns because a high return on assets indicates that these assets were purchased by the firm at a discount (i.e., that they carry a high risk premium). Specifically, suppose that the market for capital being purchased by a firm is competitive and efficient. When a firm makes an R&D expenditure to purchase innovative capital, the price it pays is appropriately discounted for risk. For concreteness, we can think, for example, of a firm that acquires a high-tech target at a competitive market price.3 In this scenario, a firm on average achieves higher return (large number of patents, resulting in high cash flows) on its innovative expenditures as fair compensation if its purchased innovative capital is highly risky, and it receives low return if capital is relatively low-risk. Past innovative efficiency is, therefore, a proxy for risk, so firms that have high past innovative efficiency (IE) should subsequently be productive in patenting (Dierickx and Cool, 1989) and earn higher profits and stock returns.4 In other words, q-theory also predicts a positive IE-return relation. </s>"

Beginning date: 2014
Main purpose: To study the causal effects of air pollution on social conflicts in China
Development stage: Completed study
 </s><s>Assistant: Although much research identifying the impact of air pollution on social interactions as well as health outcomes has been published, the topic of whether and how air pollution affects social conflicts has been comparatively underexplored. Social conflicts can impose substantial welfare and public costs on society, motivating us to conduct this study. In this paper, we use daily data to study the causal effects of air pollution on social conflicts in 90% of ~300 cities in China from 2014 to 2020. China serves as an ideal setting for this study due to several reasons. First, high-quality data on daily administrative social conflicts—in conjunction with daily air pollution and weather data—allow us to overcome identification problems such as measurement errors and the presence of unobserved correlated factors. Second, the detailed information on social conflicts allows us to discuss the sources of heterogeneity such as different workplaces and economic development levels, providing possible clues to enable the government to construct well-informed and targeted environmental policies to mitigate the adverse consequences of air pollution. Third, because of the large variations in air pollution in China, we are able to identify the effect of air pollution on social conflicts over a wide range of pollution exposure level, and the nonlinear estimates could provide a reference for settings in either countries with low levels of pollution (e.g., the United States and the European Union) or countries with more pronounced pollution (e.g., China and India).

""Enforcer"": Not specified
""Beginning date"": Not specified
""Main purpose"": To investigate how customer and supplier concentrations impact firm resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic
 </s><s>Assistant: To bring clarity to this important question, our study makes use of the dramatic changes in demand and supply during COVID-19 and investigates how such dramatic changes intertwine with customer/supplier concentration to influence firm resilience. We draw on resource-dependence theory (RDT) to understand the underlying mechanisms. RDT posits that firms de pend on external entities for resources (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Such dependent relationships vary considerably in terms of the level of relative dependence and the resultant power imbalance (Lumineau & Malhotra, 2011). When a party possesses more critical and scarce resources, it has more power over its counter parts, and power imbalance occurs (Emerson, 1962). Power-unbalanced relationships are more likely to trig ger opportunistic and exploitative behaviors and a focus on self-interest (Casciaro & Piskorski, 2005; Cheng et al., 2021; Karanovic et al., 2021), whereas power balanced relationships are more likely to lead to collaborative interactions and a focus on mutual interests. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License (Kumar et al., 1998). We postulate that the dramatic shifts in demand and supply during the pandemic reshape resource dependence within supply chains (Craighead et al., 2020), alleviating or worsening the power imbalance issues between firms and their concentrated partners and thus shaping the effect of customer and supplier concentrations on firm resilience.

Specifically, considering the divergent patterns of demand and supply shifts in different stages of the pan demic, our study focuses on both the disruption and resto ration stages. During the disruption stage, when the demand for most products drops, the downstream parties reduce their dependence on upstream parties for inputs, whereas the upstream parties increase their dependence on downstream parties for orders and revenues. As a result, the power relationship between focal firms and their concentrated customers is more unbalanced, and that with concentrated suppliers is more balanced. During the restoration stage, when demand soars and supply becomes the bottleneck, the downstream parties increase their dependence on upstream parties for inputs, whereas the upstream parties are overwhelmed with demand and less dependent on downstream parties for orders. Consequently, the power relationship between focal firms and their concentrated customers is more balanced, and that with concentrated suppliers is more unbalanced. Accordingly, we postulate that customer concentration is detrimental in the disruption stage and becomes beneficial in the restoration stage; supplier concentration is beneficial in the disruption stage but becomes detrimental in the restoration stage. </s>"

Development stage: Not specified
 </s><s>Assistant: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with an average annual economic growth of approximately 5.3% between 2007 and 2019. In which Vietnam is one of the leaders in economic performance1 and considered as Asia’s next dragon. Under this stellar performance, the banking system is the backbone of the Vietnamese economy since the stock market is relatively underdeveloped. Healthy and sustainable profitability is one of the main predictors of financial distress and a bank crisis (Demirgüç-Kunt & Detragiache, 2000). This also reflects the quality of management, shareholder’s behavior, bank’s competitive strategies, efficiency, and risk management capacity. As IC is one of the increasingly important factors contributing to the success of banks, it is crucial to investigate whether IC has any effect on bank profitability in Vietnam. Since entering to World Trade Organization in 2007, the presence of foreign banks in the market has increased. Two forms of foreign participation are a green-field investment and the acquisitions of a minority share.2 The presence of foreign-owned banks resulted in fierce competition for deposits and loans, thereby may affect domestic banks’ profitability. In response, along with shifting towards non-traditional activities, domestic banks should further improve their IC efficiency. Furthermore, the market also has witnessed the increasing competition between state-owned commercial banks and privately owned commercial banks (Le et al., 2019). This competitiveness puts further pressure on banks to maintain a stable source of income. These banks should consider IC efficiency as their long-term goal. Given the diversified structure of the Vietnamese banking system, this necessitates conducting empirical research to investigate whether IC could enhance bank profitability in Vietnam. </s>"

 </s><s>Assistant: Notably, the recent rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies brings new challenges for companies concerning CSR. AI is a core disruptive technology in Industry 4.0 that includes neural networks, machine learning, natural language processing, and image processing. It has become increasingly popular in processing big data and providing solutions for many industries (e.g., Cui et al. 2020b, Leachman and Merlino 2017, Li et al. 2016). For example, AI-empowered chatbots are found to significantly improve the effectiveness of inexperienced workers (Luo et al. 2019). Given the clear benefit of AI, an increasing number of companies are deploying AI more innovatively for their business. Nearly 50% of the respondents to a survey conducted by McKinsey said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business unit in 2020 (Balakrishnan et al. 2020). Nevertheless, the popularity of AI has also raised increasing concerns about AI ethics such as large[1]scale layoffs, data security, and privacy issues. McKinsey’s survey showed that 39% of the respondents thought individual privacy was a risk relative to AI that they should consider (Balakrishnan et al. 2020), and another survey showed that 59% of AI tech workers have experience working on products that they feel might be harmful to society (Miller and Coldicutt 2019). The serious concerns about AI ethics require high AI innovation (AII) firms to give greater consideration to CSR, especially in the process of AI implementation.1 In this regard, the intended effect of conducting CSR on the associated risk may be affected in the presence of firms’ AII. Additionally, as AII is a strong differentiation strategy, can firms with high AII still benefit from the differentiation effect of CSR? This scenario forces companies to reconsider their CSR strategies. Will AII influence the impact of CSR? How can a company’s CSR strategy be adjusted according to its level of AII?

There may be two opposite ways in which AII moderates the impact of CSR on IR. The public’s high CSR expectation of high-AII firms (discussed above) may weaken the positive effect of CSR as stakeholders may take companies’ CSR efforts for granted such as providing staff training to help them counter the risk of unemployment. From the perspective of RBV, AII is also a differentiation strategy for enterprises that may be even more effective than CSR (Hull and Rothenberg 2008). Companies with high AII may have already differentiated themselves well, which can limit the positive effect of CSR. In contrast, it is also possible that companies with high AII have a good degree of recognition; thus, their CSR is more likely to be noticed by other stakeholders, which may strengthen the positive effect of CSR (Mishra 2017). Motivated by these conflicting effects, this paper aims to confirm AII’s moderating effect to help companies develop an optimal CSR strategy. </s>"

 </s><s>Assistant: The incorporation of counties into prefectures is a centralization effort by the Chinese central government. In China, counties were independent administrative entities with their own local governments. Prefecture-level divisions (referred to as “prefecture” hereafter) were higher-level administrative units that oversaw regional policies and coordination between counties.2 Before the reform, there were often regulatory and administrative barriers between counties and prefectures, which could lead to inefficient resource allocation. The incorporation reform merged a county into the prefecture that used to oversee it, resulting in the county governments losing some of their autonomy and becoming agencies of the prefecture-level government. The barriers between the county and the prefecture disappeared, and the two local markets were expected to integrate more closely. </s>"

Other information: EZs contribute to more than 30% of China's GDP and one-third of its foreign direct investment. The central government provides strong support and grants EZs a high degree of autonomy. EZs have been successful in increasing local capital investment, employment, output, productivity, and average wages.
 </s><s>Assistant: Policymakers throughout the world widely pursue place-based policies as an important instrument to bolster local economies (Neumark and Simpson, 2015). For example, the United States has a large number of programs using state enterprise zones to improve local labor markets (Ham et al., 2011, Austin et al., 2018). France and the United Kingdom introduced similar enterprise zone policies to support business growth (Gobillon et al., 2012). As the largest developing country, China has implemented place-based policies in economic zones (EZs) to promote development since the country’s economic reform and open up in 1978. As of 2018, 2,543 national-level and provincial-level EZs encompassed almost every Chinese city, covering a total area of 17,973.89 square kilometers.1 The central government has provided strong support and granted zones with a high degree of autonomy, making EZs a tremendously successful economic tool (Wang, 2013). By 2021, the number of various zones (national level, provincial level, and lower level) has risen to over 15,000, contributing to more than 30% of China’s GDP and one-third of its foreign direct investment.2 The popularity of place-based policies has drawn increasing attention from researchers. Many studies have investigated the economic impacts of place-based policies, including job creation (Neumark and Kolko, 2010, Kolko and Neumark, 2010), capital investment, output, the number of firms (Chaurey, 2017), tariffs (Grant, 2020), welfare (Blouri and Ehrlich, 2020), economic activity density (Ehrlich and Seidel, 2018), and spillover effects (Greenstone et al., 2010, Alkon, 2018). In the context of China, several studies have shown that China’s EZ programs significantly increased local capital investment, employment, output, productivity, and average wages (Wang, 2013, Zheng et al., 2017, Lu et al., 2019). </s>"

WMPs are sold by banks to households, who then invest the raised money into underlying assets such as loans, bonds, equities, money-market rates, foreign currencies, and commodities. The risk of WMPs is lower than other investment tools, while the return is higher than bank deposits. Each WMP requires a minimum investment of usually above RMB 50,000 (approximately USD 7,200). Selling WMPs and investing the raised money belong to banks' off-balance-sheet activities.
 </s><s>Assistant: WMPs are the second-largest type of non-housing investments for households in China, next to stocks. As the largest component of China's shadow-banking sector, WMPs are a very important channel through which households' savings are invested in the real economy. WMPs are a financial innovation that was initiated in 2004 by commercial banks in China. Banks design the terms in the contracts of WMPs (including the promised yields), sell the WMPs to households, and then invest the raised money into underlying assets (including loans, bonds, equities, money-market rates, foreign currencies, and commodities such as gold).2 Fig. 1 displays the investment cash flows among households, WMPs, and the underlying assets. The type of underlying assets of a WMP is specified in the contract at the time of issuance. Afterward, banks distribute part of the revenue generated from the underlying assets to the WMP buyers as the principal and interest payments according to the agreement. The realized returns of the underlying assets are not visible to the WMP buyers. The risk of WMPs is much lower than that of other investment tools, such as stocks and commercial bonds; while the return on WMPs is much higher than that on bank deposits. Each WMP requires a minimum investment for a buyer, usually above RMB 50,000 (approximately USD 7,200). Different from receiving deposits and making loans, selling WMPs and investing the money raised from WMPs belong to banks' off-balance-sheet activities rather than on-balance-sheet activities. At the end of 2017, the total value of outstanding WMPs reached RMB 29.54 trillion (approximately USD 4.25 trillion). During 2017, banks issued 93,500 individual WMPs. </s>"
